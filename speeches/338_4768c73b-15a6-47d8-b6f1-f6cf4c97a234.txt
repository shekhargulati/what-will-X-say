The dignitaries also flagged off the inaugural run of Bandhan Express between Kolkata and Khulna.\nExternal affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj, also joined the event from New Delhi.\nFollowing is the text of the Prime Minister's address on the occasion:\n\"Hello to all the people associated with this broadcast, and especially to all the brothers and sisters living in Bangladesh.\nA few days ago, the festival of Deepawali, Durga Puja and Kali Puja was celebrated in both the countries.\nI wish the two nationals best wishes for this festival season.\nI'm glad you got a chance to meet again via video conference\nOur best wishes for your health.\nFrom the very beginning I have been convinced that with the leaders of neighboring countries, there really should be relationships like neighbors.\nWhen it comes to mind, there should be talk, visits should be done.\nIn all of this we should not stay in the bond of protocol.\nShortly before, we did a video conference at the launch of South Asia Satellite.\nLast year we did this in the same way as inaugurating Petrapole ICP.\nAnd I am happy that today we inaugurated important projects which strengthen our connectivity through video conferencing.\nThe most important dimension of connectivity is our people-to-people connectivity.\nAnd today the inauguration of the international passenger terminus will facilitate travelers of the Kolkata-Dhaka Friendship Express and the Kolkata-Khulna Bandhan Express which started today.\nThis will not only ease them in customs and immigration, but also save 3 hours during their travel time.\nFriendship and bondage, the names of these two rail facilities are also in line with our shared vision.\nWhenever we talk of connectivity, I always feel the vision of restoring your pre-1965 connectivity.\nI am very happy that we are continuously moving forward in this direction.\nToday we have also inaugurated two railway bridges. The bridge built at a cost of around 100 million dollars will help strengthen Bangladesh's rail network.\nBeing a trusted partner in Bangladesh's development work is a matter of pride for India.\nI am happy that there is a good progress on projects under the commitment of our 8 billion dollars concessional (Kanase-Moon) finance.\nBoth Development and Connectivity are connected together, and today we have taken some more steps towards strengthening the relations between the two countries which are centuries old historical links, especially among the people of West Bengal and Bangladesh.\nI have full faith that as we increase our ties and strengthen relationships between people, we will touch new skies of growth and prosperity.\nI extend my heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji for the cooperation in this work, and the heart of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.\nThank you.\n\n\nShortly before, we did a video conference at the launch of South Asia Satellite.
