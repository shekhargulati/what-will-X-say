"Incident is heart rending: PM Modi on Kerala Temple Fire\nI extend my condolences to the families who lost their loved ones: PM Modi\nI pray for speedy recovery of those injured in the temple tragedy: PM Modi\nCenter is ready to extend all possible help for this tragic incident: PM on Kerala Temple Fire\nThe incident that is happening today is very painful. No one can imagine that death can come in such a way and in such a large number of people seriously injured ... I saw the place where the accident occurred today, went to that temple. I went to the hospital in Kollam, talked to the Chief Minister here, my feelings for those families who have lost their loved ones. Those who have suffered are healthy, such is my prayer to God.\nI have told the Chief Minister that those who are serious patients will have to shift somewhere in Delhi, then the Government of India will arrange them. The Government of India is completely with Kerala in the hour of crisis, with unhappy families. The accident is so fierce that it is very difficult to utter in words. People have suffered two hundred and two hundred meters. Now the doctor was telling me that some blasts were such that the body and crane broke somewhere. I can guess what a fatal accident will be.\nBut the Government of India is completely with Kerala in the hour of grief, is with the families of the unhappy and those families, with the people of Kerala, will be fully helped."
