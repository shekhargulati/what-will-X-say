But, I rest assured, we all rest assured, that one of India's strongest well-wishers, Prime Minister Lee is in the driving seat for Singapore and for our bilateral relations. Excellency Lee, you are a friend of India We are committed to strengthening our relationships. It is really a great honor for me to welcome you here today.\nFriends,\nMy first visit to Singapore as Prime Minister was on a special occasion, to pay our respect to Lee Kuan Yew, a guiding light not just for Singapore, but for the whole of Asia. This year, we were saddened by the demise of another great son of Singapore, former President S. R. Nathan. He was a close friend of India, and we had the honor of offering him the Pravasi Indian Samman. We will miss him\nFriends,\nSingapore's National Anthem is \"Majulah Singapura\" - \"Onward, Singapore\" No surprise, therefore, that if there is one country that seems to act in the present, but is the needs of the future, it is Singapore. Whether it is manufacturing, environment, innovation, technology, or delivery of public services, Singapore is today\nFriends,\nLess than twelve months ago, during my visit to Singapore, we had upgraded our level of strategic partnership with \"Renewed Spirit, New Energy\". To our customers, our partnership is aimed at combinations of strengths Singapore with the scale of India; and dynamism of Singapore with the vibrancy of our states. During my visit last year, we had drawn up a road map to realize our ambi- dative cooperative agenda.Since the decisions of expeditious implementation have also been included in our engagement Today, Excellency Lee and I undertook a detailed review of our strategic partnership. During my visit to Singapore, Prime Minister Lee had taken a tour to the Institute for Technical Education. Today, we have signed two MOUs focused on skill development: one, to set up a Skill Development Center for our North Eastern States in Guwahati; and the other with the National Skill Development Council. I also welc ome the inauguration of the center of excellence for Tourism Training in Udaipur, in cooperation with the State Government of Rajasthan. Rajasthan is also partnering with Singapore's in the fields of urban development and waste management. Singapore is already our partner in developing Amaravati, the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh.\nFriends,\nThe trade and investment ties form the bedrock of our bilateral relations. We enjoy a strong network of business partnerships. In this context, Prime Minister Lee and I have agreed to expedite the second review of our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. The MOU on Intellectual Property, which has been signed today, will facilitate greater business to business exchanges and collaborations. Prime Minister Lee and I also welcome the issuance of corporate rupee bonds in Singapore. It is a step forward in our efforts to mobilize\nFriends,\nOur defense and security cooperation is a key pillar of our strategic partnership. As two marine countries, keeping the sea lanes of communication open, and respect for international legal order of seas and oceans is a shared priority. Our cooperation in the framework of ASEAN, East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Framework is aimed at building an open and inclusive architecture for regional cooperation, in an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Rising tide of terrorism, specifically cross-border terrorism, and the rise of radicalization are serious challenges for our security. They threaten the very fabric of our societies It is my firm belief that those who believe in peace and humanity need to stand up and act. Today, we have agreed to enhance our cooperation to counter these threats, including in the domain of cyber security.\nExcellency Lee,\nIndia has embarked on a path of strong economic growth and transformation. In this journey, we consider Singapore as a key partner. Recently, we are benefited from Deputy Prime Minister Shanmugaratnam's ideas on transforming India. I also deeply value your personal friendship, and your leadership in taking our bilateral relations forward. Once again, I extend to you and your delegation my warmest welcome I am confident that your visit to India will be productive and successful.\nThank you.\nThank you very much\nOne of India's strongest well-wishers, Prime Minister Lee is in the driving seat for Singapore and for our bilateral relations: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nBe it manufacturing, environment, innovation, tech or delivery of public services, Singapore is today what the world will do tomorrow: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM commends the success of Singapore: If there is one country that looks like in the present, but is alive to the future, it is Singapore pic.twitter.com/MD5083Enof\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nToday, Excellency Lee and I undertook a detailed review of our strategic partnership: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nI welcome the establishment of the Center of Excellence for Tourism Training in Udaipur, in cooperation with Government of Rajasthan: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM: Our partnership aims to improve the strengths of Singapore with the scale of India; \u0026 dynamism of Singapore with vibrancy of our States pic.twitter.com/1cQIHDY5Ih\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nRajasthan is also partnering with Singapore in the fields of urban development and waste management: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nSingapore is already our partner in developing Amaravati, the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi speaks of trade and investment ties that form the bedrock of the bilateral relations pic.twitter.com/TlRcZ4tazA\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nPrime Minister Lee and I have agreed to expedite the second review of our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nThe MOU on Intellectual Property, which has been signed today, will facilitate greater business to business exchanges and collaborations: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: Our defense and security cooperation is a key pillar of our strategic partnership\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: As the maritime countries, keeping sea lanes of comm'n open, and respect for int'l legal order of oceans is a shared priority.\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: Rising tide of terrorism, specifically cross-border terrorism, and the rise of radicalization are serious challenges to security pic.twitter.com/I58OGwbAIH\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM on terrorism: It is my firm belief that those who believe in peace \u0026 humanity need to stand and act against this disease.\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 4, 2016\nI am confident that your visit to India will be productive and successful: PM @narendramodi to PM @leehsienloong\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 4, 2016\nPM concludes: In our path of strong growth and transformation, we cite Singapore as a key partner.
