This symbolizes a spirit of vigilance- that we have to protect nature and mold our activities in our ecological surroundings.\nMy home state, Gujarat is the land of Somnath The call of the people and the longing for service took me to Kashi, the land of Vishwanath.\nFrom Somnath to Vishwanath, from Kedarnath to Rameshwaram and from Kashi to Coimbatore, where we have gathered, Lord Shiva is everywhere.\nLike crores of Indians across the length and breadth of the nation, I too feel happy to be part of celebrations of Maha-Shivratri.\nAnd we are only drops in the ocean\nThrough centuries, there were lived countless devotees, in every age and time.\nThey came from different places\nTheir language has been different but their longing for the divine is always the same.\nThis longing throbs in the heart of every human heart. Their poetry, their music, their love has been soaked in the earth\nStanding here before this 112-feet face of Adiyogi and Yogeshwar Linga, we are experiencing a huge presence enveloping everyone in the space.\n\nIn the times to come, the place where we have been gathered to be a source of inspiration, a place to immerse one's self and discover truth.\nThis place will continue to inspire everyone to become Shiva-mum. It will remind us of the inclusive spirit of Lord Shiva.\nToday, Yoga has come as a long way.\nThere are different definitions, types, schools of Yoga and ways to practice Yoga that have emerged.\nThis is the beauty of Yoga-it is ancient, yet modern, it is constant, yet evolving\nThe essence of Yoga has not changed.\nAnd I say this is very important to preserve this essence.\nOtherwise, we may just have to discover a new yoga to re-discover the soul and essence of Yoga.\nYoga is the catalytic agent, ushering the transformation from Jiva to Shiva\nWe have been told here - Yatra Jivas: Tattra Shiva:\nThe journey from Shiva to Jiva, that is the Yoga.\nBy practicing Yoga, a spirit of aneness is created - aneness of the mind, body and the intellect.\nOneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet ... this is Yoga\nYoga is the journey from 'me' to 'we.'\nThis journey is from person to peace. This feeling from me to me, from the key to the age, this expansion, this is Yoga.\nIndia is a land of unparalleled diversity India's diversity can be seen, heard, felt, touched and tasted\nThe diversity has been India's greatest strength and has also brought together India.\nThink of Lord Shiva and the picture that comes to mind is that of his Majestic presence at Mount Kailash, in the mighty Himalayas. Think of Goddess Parvati and you remember the beautiful Kanyakumari, which is surrounded by the vast oceans. The union of Shiva and Parvati is a union of the Himalayas with the oceans.\nShiv and Parvati ... this is a message of oneness.\nAnd look at how much this manifests itself:\nAround the neck of Lord Shiva, there is a snake. The 'Vahan' of Lord Ganesh is the mouse We are well aware of the frosty relations between a snake and a mouse. Yet, they live together\nSimilarly, the 'Vahan' of Kartikeya is the peacock. Peacocks and snakes are supposed to harbor great enmity. Even then, they live together\nThe family of Lord Shiva is diverse yet\nDiversity is not a cause of conflict for us We accept it and embrace it whole heartedly\nIt is a specialty of our culture that there is a god or goddess, there is either a animal, a bird or a tree that is associated with him or her\nThat animal, bird or tree is also worshiped with the same spirit as the God or Goddess. There can not be a better way to inculcate a spirit of reverence for nature. Nature equals to God, showing their foresight, showing their foresight\nOur scriptures say: Ekamat, Vipra: Most often,\nTruth is one, sages call it by different names.\nWe have been living these virtues since our compassion and kindness, kindness, brotherhood and harmony are naturally a part of us.\nThese are values ​​we have seen our ancestors live and die for.\nThese are virtues that have kept the Indian culture alive for centuries.\nOur mind should always be open to new thoughts and ideas from all sides Unfortunately, there are a select few, who in order to hide their own ignorance, take a very rigid view and destroy any scope of welcoming new thoughts and experiences.\nRejecting an idea that can be potentially harmful. It is necessary to analyze it, try it and try to take it in the new generation\nThe progress of humanity is incomplete without the empowerment of women The issue is not long\nI am proud of the fact that women are central.\nOur culture has so many goddesses who are worshiped.\nIndia is home to many women saints, who led the movements for social reform be it in the north, south, east or west.\nThey shattered stereotypes, broken barriers and became trendsetters.\nYou will be interested to know, that in India we say - Nari Tu Narayani, Nari Tu Narayani - woman is a manifestation of the divine\nBut what is said for a man, for man we say Narayana happens if you do something - if a man does good deeds, he will attain divinity\nDo you see the difference in the situation of women is unconditional Women unconditional women, Narayanani for men, it is conditional. He can earn it after good deeds.\nThat is why why Sadhguru insists that one takes the name of a mother to the world. A mother is someone who is unconditionally inclusive.\nThe changing lifestyles of the 21st century have brought their own set of challenges.\nLifestyle related illnesses, stress related diseases are becoming more and more common The communicable illnesses can be controlled but what about the non-communicable ones?\nIt gives me immense sadness, one that I can not describe in words, when I read about people taking substance abuse and alcohol because they are not at peace with themselves.\nToday, the whole world wants peace, not just peace from wars and conflict of peace\nThe burden of stress takes a heavy toll and one of the sharpest weapons\nThere is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic conditions. If the body is a temple of the mind, yoga creates a beautiful temple.\nThat is why I call Yoga a passport to health assurance More than being a cure to ailments, it is a means to wellness.\nYoga is about freedom from diseases (desisting from worldly greed).\nYoga makes the person a better person in thought, action, knowledge and devotion.\nIt will be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.\nYou can see people twist and turn their bodies in many sorts of fashion. But they are not all yogis\nYoga is far beyond physical exercises\nThrough Yoga, we will create a new Yuga - a Yuga of togetherness and harmony.\nWhen India mooted the idea of ​​the International Yoga Day at the United Nations, it had received open arms.\nThe world celebrated both the Yoga Days, 21st June 2015 and 2016 with greatfervour.\nBe it Korea or Canada, Sweden or South Africa- in every part of the world. The rays of the sun were welcomed by Yogis, engaged in the practice of Yoga.\nThe coming together of so many nations to mark the International Day of Yoga illustrates the real essence of Yoga-aloneness.\nYoga has the potential to start a new yuga (a new era) - a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.\nOne really remarkable thing that Sadhguru has done is made out of ordinary, common people People who stay with their families and work in the world, but who are living at the peaks within themselves - undergoing intense and wonderful experiences on a daily basis. Wherever one is, whatever is in one place, one can be a yogi.\nI see so many radiant and joyous faces here I see people working with utmost love and care, paying attention to the smallest details. I see people full of energy and enthusiasm to offer themselves to a greater cause.\nAdiyogi will inspire many generations My gratitude for Sadhguru\nThank you. Thank you very much Hymn"
