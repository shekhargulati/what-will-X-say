The whole world, 196 nations, have come together in the future\nThis summit is of great significance to India's future, too.\nThis pavilion is a window to our heritage and our progress; our traditions and our technology; our aspirations and our achievements\nIndia's new economic momentum is a subject of international attention. Our progress will not just change the lives of one-sixth of humanity. It will also mean a more successful and prosperous world.\nEqually, the choices the world makes here will have an impact on our development.\nClimate change is a major global challenge\nBut, the climate change is not It is the result of global warming that came from the prosperity and progress of an industrial age.\nBut, we in India face its consequences today. We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters.\nWe are concerned about the rising oceans that will threaten our 7500 km of coastline and over 1300 islands. We worry about the retreat of glaciers that feed our rivers and nurture our civilization.\nThat is why the outcome in Paris so important\nThat is why we are here\nWe want the world to act with urgency We want a comprehensive, equitable and durable agreement, which should lead us to restore the balance between humanity and Nature and between what we have inherited and what we will leave behind\nThis will mean a partnership in which those who have the luxury of choices and the capability of technology will make adjustments to their carbon emissions.\nThe extent of their commitment and the strength of their action\nAnd, they should leave enough of our countries\nThey should share resources and technology with those people who live in the future.\nIt will also mean that the developing world will also try to be a lighter carbon footprint on their growth path.\nWe want the conviction of the world to be matched by our efforts\nBecause our challenge is pressing, our efforts must be urgent\nFriends,\nThis will be the subject of negotiations\nI am here in the Indian Pavilion And, I speak not only to the world, but also to our people\nIndia's progress is our destiny But, we are a nation that should lead in combating climate change.\nIt stems from our obligations to give our people clean air; clean rivers; resilient farms; healthy habitats; and, forests rich with life\nIt comes from our conviction that we should not only aim in higher earnings, but better quality of life.\nIt comes from our commitment to the world\nAbove all, it arises, from our timeless traditions and beliefs.\nThe choices a people make are shaped by their culture and beliefs.\nIn India, Nature has always been treated as Mother.\nSince ancient times, we have seen humanity as part of Nature, not superior to it. The divine is manifested in Nature's variety.\nWe have always believed that Nature does not exist for human race, but that we can not exist without Nature. So, Nature is meant to provide and nurture, not to exploit.\nWhen Nature is in equilibrium, our lives and our world will be in balance.\nThis is what we learn from Sukta in our\nRig Veda\nRegional Addresses Madhumanturamin Dhanuriv Pyo Asmasu Dhubhavya\nMadhusuchutam Ghendamiv Suputamdasya Nastayeto Merylantu\nThis means:\nO Lord Of Field, with the Sweet Waves of Mother Nature's blessings, May you milk our fields like the milk of a cow\nWith the Sweetness of Mother Nature's bounty, which falls like Clarified Butter, May you shed your Grace on us.\nThis is why Atharva-Veda calls it a bounden duty that we should protect the Earth so that Life can be sustained.\nThis is what we see in Gandhiji's life and his advice is that the person has enough for everyone's need but not for anyone's greed\nThis is what we have tried to capture in the publication PARAMPARA that we release today.\nThis is why recycling and conservation comes naturally to us. And, why we have sacred groves across our nation\nFriends,\nAnd, it is this spirit that leads us to set an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to combat climate change.\nWe have a target for renewable generation of 175 Gigawatt by 2022. We have got off to a good start, with around 12 GW likely to be installed by 2016, more than three times the current capacity.\nLike cellular phones before, we can use renewable energy to bring power to our 18000 unconnected villages quickly and cleanly\nBy 2030, 40% of our installed capacity will be based on non-fossil fuel.\nWe will convert waste to energy We will make our cities smart and sustainable, and transform public transport, including through 50 new metro rail projects.\nWe are investing in supercritical technology We have imposed tax on coal and reduced subsidies on petroleum products. We are raising fuel standards for automobiles. And, we have introduced tax free bonds for renewable energy\nWe have a massive program to expand our forest cover and protect our biodiversity.\nIn the past few months, millions of households have switched to LED bulbs and we have had plans to replace diesel by fuel cells.\nOur vision of India as a global manufacturing hub rests on the simple principle of \"zero defect, zero effect\" - production that is perfect and leaves no footprint on environment.\nOur mission of \"more crop per drop\" will not only affect the scarce resource.\nAnd, research and innovation in clean energy\nWe want to make conventional energy, like coal, cleaner\nWe will also make renewable energy available in our homes. We want to make it more reliable and easy to feed.\nFrom governments to communities, there are many examples of innovation and enterprise.\nI have tried to capture some of these initiatives in my book, Convenient Action, which we will present today.\nFriends,\nThis is the voice of our people, the call of our nation and the consensus of our polity.\nIndia's leadership on the vision of the Indian leaders and successive governments - from Stockholm in 1975 to Copenhagen in 2009.\nWe are raising our national effort And, we are intensifying our international partnerships\nSo, we come to Paris with our commitment, but we also come with hope.\nSo, we approach the negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in a spirit of partnership, which must be based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.\nLater today, I will join leaders from major for a innovation summit; Because I believe that innovation and technology hold the key to our collective success.\nPresident Hollande and I will also co-chair the launch of my long cherished dream of an international solar power project in Solar Energy in the 121 solar-rich countries.\nTo call the world to look deep in the ancient wisdom, all our civilizations, cultures and religions, I asked President Hollande to bring out a book of quotations from around the world. I am happy that we will release today\nAnd, I will also call for a change in life style, so that we can reduce the burden on our planet. For, the enduring success of our efforts will depend on the way we live and think.\nIn conclusion, therefore, let me return to the theme that defines us in India - the spirit of partnership, the belief that oneness with the whole is Nature.\nTo the people of India and our friends in the world, I call you to live with the commitment of 'Lokah Samastah Sukhinau Bhavantu'.\nThe desire for well being should include our planet, our nature, all countries and the whole humanity\nIf our thinking is right, we will form a true global partnership of capabilities and needs that leads to a low carbon age.\nThank you.\nThank you very much\nIndia pavilion also wants to demonstrate the strong belief that the world needs to look beyond climate change \u0026 focus on Climate Justice\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 30, 2015\nIndia pavilion also wants to demonstrate the strong belief that the world needs to look beyond climate change \u0026 focus on Climate Justice\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 30, 2015\nThe India Pavilion at @ COP21 has used technology to showcase India's commitment to climate change \u0026 focus on climate justice. @ India4climate"
