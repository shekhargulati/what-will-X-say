India applauds, the great sacrifices of the men and women from 'The Land of the Brave' in the service of humanity\nIndia knows what this means because our soldiers too have fallen in the battlefields for the same ideals.\nThat is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies.\nMr. Speaker,\nOur countries have been shaped by different histories, cultures, and faiths.\nYet, our belief in democracy for our countries and liberty for our countrymen is common.\nThe idea that all citizens are created is a central pillar of the American constitution.\nOur founding fathers too shared the same belief and demanded individual liberty for every citizen of India.\nThere were many who doubted India when, as a new independent nation, we reposed our faith in democracy\nIndeed, wagers had made our failure\nBut, the people of India did not wait.\nOur founders created a modern nation with freedom, democracy, and equality as the essence of its soul.\nAnd, in doing so, they have ensured that we continue to celebrate our age old diversity.\nToday, across its streets and institutions, in its villages and cities, anchored in equal respect for all faiths; and in the melody of hundreds of its languages ​​and dialects.\nIndia lives as one; India grows as one; India celebrates as one\nMr. Speaker,\nModern India is in its 70th year\nFor my government, The Constitution\nAnd, in that holy book, freedom of faith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless of background, are enshrined as fundamental rights.\n800 million of my countrymen may be the freedom of franchise once every five years.\nBut, all the 1.25 billion of our citizens have had freedom from fear, a freedom they exercise every moment of their lives\nDistinguished Members,\nEngagement among our democracies has been shown in the manner in which our thinkers have influenced one another, and shaped the course of our societies.\nThoreau's idea of ​​civil disobedience influenced our political ideas.\nAnd, likewise the call by the great sage of India Swami Vivekananda to embrace humanity.\nGandhi's non-violence inspired the heroism of Martin Luther King\nToday, a distance of 3 miles separates the Martin Luther King memorial at Tidal Basin from the statue of Gandhi at Massachusetts Avenue.\nThis proximity of their memorials in Washington mirrors the values ​​of values ​​and values ​​they believe in.\nThe genius of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was nurtured in the years he spent the Columbia University a century ago.\nThe impact of the U.S. Constitution on him was reflected in his drafting of the Indian constitution some three decades later.\nOur independence was ignited by the same idealism\nNo wonder then that former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee called India and the U.S. 'natural allies'\nNo wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of freedom have shaped the bedrock of our ties.\nNo wonder then, that President Obama has called our ties the defining partnership of the 21st century.\nMr. Speaker,\nMore than fifteen years ago, Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee stood here and gave a call to step out of the 'shadow of hesitation' of the past.\nThe pages of our friendship then tell a remarkable story\nToday, our relationship has overcome the hesitations of history.\nComfort, candour and convergence define our conversations.\nThrough the cycle of elections and transitions of administrations the intensity of our engagement is only grown.\nAnd, in this exciting journey, the U.S. Congress has acted as its compass\nYou helped us turn barriers in bridges of partnership\nIn the fall of 2008, when the Congress passed the India-U.S. Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, it changed the colors of our relations.\nYou are the most\nYou also have times in sad\nIndia will never forget the solidarity shown by the US Congress when terrorists from across our border attacked Mumbai in November 2008.\nAnd for this, we are grateful\nMr. Speaker,\nI am informed that the work of the U.S. Congress is harmonious\nI am also told that you are well-known for your bipartisanship\nWell, you are not alone.\nTime and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament, especially in our Upper House.\nSo, as you can see, we have many shared practices\nMr. Speaker,\nAs this country knows well, every travel has its pioneers.\nVery early on, they shaped a development partnership\nThe genius of Norman Borlaug brought the Green Revolution and food security to India\nThe Excellence of the American Universities Nurtured Institutes of Technology and Management in India\nAnd, I could go on\nFast forward to today.\nThe embrace of our partnership extends to the whole of human endeavour-from the depths of the oceans to the vastness of the space.\nOur S \u0026 T collaboration continues in the fields of public health, education, food, and agriculture.\nTies of commerce and investment are flourishing We trade more with the U.S. than with any other nation\nAnd, the flow of goods, services and capital between us generates jobs in both our societies\nAs in trade, so in defense India exercises with the United States more than we do with any other partner. Defense purchases have moved from almost zero to ten billion dollars in less than a decade.\nOur cooperation also secures our cities and citizens from terrorists, and protects our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.\nCivil Nuclear Cooperation, as I said President Obama yesterday, is a reality.\nMr. Speaker,\nOur people and there is a close cultural connection between our societies\nSIRI tells us that India's ancient heritage of Yoga has over 30 million practitioners in the US.\nIt is estimated that more Americans bend for yoga than to a curve ball.\nAnd, no Mr. Speaker, we have not yet claimed intellectual property right on Yoga.\nConnecting our two nations is also a unique and dynamic bridge of three million Indian Americans.\nToday, they are among your best CEOs; academics; astronauts; scientists; economists; doctors; even spelling bee champions\nThey are your strength They are also the proud of India They symbolize the best of both societies\nMr. Speaker,\nMy understanding of public office\nLong before the assuming office, I traveled to coast, covering more than 25 States of America.\nI realized then that the real strength of the U.S. was in the dreams of its ambitions\nToday, Mr. Speaker, a similar spirit animates India\nOur 800 million youth, specially, are specially impatient\nIndia is going through a deep social and economic change.\nA billion of its citizens are already politically empowered\nMy dream is to economically empower them through social and economic transformations.\nAnd, do so by 2022, the seventy-fifth anniversary of India's independence\nMy to-do list is long and ambient But you will understand\nIt includes:\n· A vibrant rural economy with strong farm sector;\n· A roof over every head and electricity to all households;\n· To skill millions of our youth;\n· Build 100 smart cities;\n· Have a broad band for a billion, and connect our villages to the digital world;\n· And create a twenty-first century rail, road and port infrastructure\nThese are not just aspirations; They are goals in the reach of a finite time-frame.\nAnd, to be achieved with a light carbon foot print, with greater emphasis on renewables\nMr. Speaker,\nIn every sector of India's forward march, I see the U.S. as an indispensable partner\nMany of you also believe that a strong and prosperous India is strategic interest.\nLet us work together in real life\nThere can be no doubt that in progressing this relationship, both countries stand to gain in great measure.\nAs the U.S. businesses search for new areas of economic growth, markets for their goods, a pool of skilled resources, and global locations to produce and manufacture, India could be their ideal partner.\nIndia's strong economy, and growth rate of 7.6% per annum, is creating new opportunities for our mutual prosperity.\nTransformative American technologies in India and growing investment by Indian companies in the United States, both have a positive impact on our citizens.\nToday, for their global research and development centers, India is the destination of choice for the U.S. companies\nLooking eastward from India, across the Pacific, the innovation of our countries is together in California.\nHere, the innovative genius of America and India's intellectual creativeism is the new industries of the future.\nMr. Speaker,\nThe 21st century has brought great opportunities.\nBut, it also comes with its own set of challenges\nInter-dependence is growing\nBut, while some parts of the world are growing economically prosperity; other are mired in conflicts\nIn Asia, the absence of an agreed security architecture creates uncertainty.\nThreats of terror are expanding, and new challenges are emerging in cyber and outer-space.\nAnd, global organizations conceived in the 20th century, seemingly new challenges or take on new responsibilities.\nIn this world full of multiple transitions and economic opportunities; growing uncertainties and political complications; existing threats and new challenges; our engagement can make a difference by promoting:\n· Cooperation not domination;"
