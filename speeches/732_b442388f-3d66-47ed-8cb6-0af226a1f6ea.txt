They keep our nation safe and our citizens safe.\nAnd, in calamity and conflicts, they do more than just relief and hope to Our people They lift the spirit of the nation and win\nIn Chennai, you battled the fury of rain and the river to save lives In Nepal, you served with courage, humility and compassion. And, as in Nepal, in Yemen's conflict, you are not allowed\nOur forces reflect our nation's diversity and its unity. They embody the timeless culture of India and the finest tradition of our military. And, their success comes from the leadership that you provide.\nToday, I express our nation's gratitude to our military.\nI pay homage to those who made the supreme sacrifice, in silence and service, so that India marches ahead.\nOur thoughts are the soldiers on the harshest frontiers of the world; with their families that say uncertain farewells when they leave home; and, their loved ones who should sometimes bear their coffins\nI know how an officer, in the prime of his youth, feels when he does not make the next grade, but because of the room above was small.\nSo, your service and uphold your welfare.\nFor this reason, we have moved with speed to implement that One rank one that has remained unfulfilled for decades. And, we will build the National War Memorial and Museum that you are very proud of in our nation's capital.\nWe will also improve skills and opportunities for our ex-servicemen, so that when they leave the service, they can still serve the nation with pride and dignity.\nI also pay tribute to our internal security forces Their valor and sacrifices defeures terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, and their North and more peaceful\nI complement our negotiators for new hope\nIndia is a exciting moment of change There is a high tide of hope and optimism in the country. There is a new level of international confidence and interest in India. We have become the fastest growing major economy in the world. And, our economy is on a more stable path.\nOur factories are humming with activity again. We are building the next generation of infrastructure. Foreign investment is rising and is India's ranking as a place to do business in.\nEvery citizen can see a future of opportunities and fulfill basic needs with confidence. This is important for India's prosperity, and also our security\nIn an inter-dependent world, India's transformation is closely linked with our international partnerships. And, so is our security\nSo, there is new intensity and purpose in our foreign policy. In the East, we have strengthened our traditional partnerships with Japan, Korea and ASEAN We have made new openings in the region, including Australia, Mongolia and Pacific Islands.\nWe have expanded our access to the Indian Ocean Region, and for the first time articulated a clear strategy for our maritime region. We have raised our engagement with Africa to a new level.\nWe have retraced our ancient links to Central Asia. We have established close relations and security cooperation in West Asia and Gulf;\nRussia has always been a source of strength It is important for our future, too\nWith the United States, we have advanced our partnership in a comprehensive way, including in defense. Our strategic partnerships have been deepened\nAcross the world, the world economy It is also seen as an anchor for regional and global peace, security and stability.\nAnd, as the world seeks to deal with growing threat of terrorism and radicalism, countries across all regions, including the Islamic world, have reached out to seek cooperation with India\nAbove all, it is our neighbourhood that is the most critical for our future and our place in the world.\nBut, ours is a difficult neighbourhood with the full spectrum of security challenges.\nWe see terrorism and ceasefire violations; reckless nuclear build up and threats; border transgressions; and, continuing military modernization and expansion The shadow of west Asian instability is becoming longer\nBeyond that, our region is marked by uncertain political transitions, weak institutions and internal conflicts. And, major powers have also increased their land and maritime neighborhood.\nFrom Maldives and Sri Lanka in the seas to Nepal and Bhutan in the mountains, we are working to safeguard our interests and our relationships.\nThe Land Boundary Agreement has boosted our growing relationship and security cooperation with Bangladesh.\nWe are engaging Pakistan to try and turn the course of history, bring an end to terrorism, build peaceful relations, advance cooperation and promote stability and prosperity in our region\nThere are many challenges and obstacles on the path. But, the effort is worth it, because the peace dividends are huge and our children are at stake.\nSo, we will test their intentions For this, we have started a new NSA-level dialogue to bring security experts\nBut, we will never drop our guard on security and we will continue to judge on their commitments on terrorism.\nWe have committed to help the great Afghan people build a united, peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation.\nWe are also pursuing close relations with China for the full potential of our economic partnership. We will aim to address outstanding issues, maintain sustainability on the border, and develop greater mutual understanding and trust in our overlapping neighborhood.\nI believe that India and China can engage constructively across the complexity of their relationship as two self-assured and confident nations, aware of their interests and responsibilities.\nWe continue to strengthen our defense capabilities and infrastructure, engage our neighbors more closely and strengthen our regional and global partnerships, including in maritime security.\nIn a world of rapid changes, India faces familiar threats and new ones. Our challenges cover land, sea and air at the same time. It includes the full range, from terrorism to conventional power.\nOur responsibilities are not confined to our borders and coastlines. They extend to our interests and citizens, spreading across a wide world and unpredictable risks.\nAs our world gets transformed, the character of economies change and technology evolves, the nature of conflicts and the objectives of war will also change.\nWe know that the old rivalries can play out in new theaters like as space and cyber. And, new technologies offer new opportunities for both traditional and new challenges.\nSo, we should be ready for the present and prepare for the future.\nIndia is confident that our defense forces are ready and do not suffer any misadventure.\nOur strategic deterrence is strong and reliable, our nuclear doctrine, and our political will\nWe have speeded up the process of defense procurements. We have approved many long pending acquisitions.\nWe are taking steps to address shortages and cater for replacements.\nWe are advancing the pace of expansion of our forces and equipment. This includes the strategic railways to the border area.\nWe are transforming defense in India through radically new policies and initiatives.\nOur public sector is gearing up to the challenge The private sector has responded with great enthusiasm\nAnd, foreign defense companies are coming here with ambitious new proposals for Make in India, from fighter jets and helicopters to transport aircraft and UAVs; from avionics to advanced material.\nWe can never call ourselves a secure nation and a strong military power unless we develop domestic capabilities. This will also reduce capital costs and inventories. In addition, it will be a huge catalyst for industry, employment and economic growth in India.\nWe will soon reform our procurement policies and process And, our offsets policy will become a strategic tool for improving our capabilities in defense technology Defence technology will now be a national endeavor that taps the potential of all institutions in our country\nArmed Forces will be crucial to the success of Make in India Mission I am encouraged by your localization plans, especially in the capital intensive navy and air force.\nWe want to see clear targets and goals on domestic acquisition; more clarity on specifications; And, greater involvement of our forces in innovation, design and development, specially from those who wield the weapons in the field.\nAbove all, we see our Armed Forces And, it can not be achieved by doing more of the same, or preparing perspective plans based on outdated doctrines and disconnected from financial realities.\nIn the course of the year, I have seen progress, but I also feel that our forces and our government need to improve their beliefs, doctrines, objectives and strategies. We must define our aims and our instruments for the changing world.\nAt a time when major powers are reducing their forces and rely more on technology, we are still constantly seeking the size of our forces.\nModernization and expansion of forces at the same time is a difficult and unnecessary goal.\nWe need forces that are agile, mobile and driven by technology, not just human valour.\nWe need capabilities to win the swift wars, we will not have the luxury of long drawn battles. We must re-examine our assumptions that keep huge funds locked up in inventories.\nAs our security horizons and responsibilities extend out to our shores and boundaries, we must limit and mobility for our forces.\nWe must fully incorporate the power of digital networks and space assets in our capabilities. Equally, we should be the defenders of our targets.\nAnd, networks must be seamless and integrated across agencies and forces, and are accurate, clear and quick in response.\nWe have been slow to repair the structures of our Armed Forces We should shorten the tooth-to-tail ratio\nAnd, we should encourage all levels of our Armed Forces We wear different colors, but we serve the same cause and bear the same flag. Jointness at the top is a need that is long overdue.\nSenior military leaders must have experience of tri-service commands, experience in technology-driven environment and exposure to the full spectrum of challenges - from terrorism to strategic\nWe need military commanders who not only lead the world in brilliantly in the field, but also have thought of our forces and security systems in the future.\nWe should learn from the experience of the others, but we must frame our systems and commands on our own genius. Our National Defense University will soon be a reality\nWe also need reforms in senior defense management It is sad that many defense reform measures have been implemented in the past. This is an area of ​​priority for me\nWe must also have a comprehensive strategy for external defense engagement, to develop our capabilities and to extend our responsibilities to peace and stability, including our extended marine region.\nWe have kept peace in the blue helmet of the UN. And, our forces can be messengers of peace and hope, for example, by taking the ships of remote island nations, and building relations with other militaries.\nIn conclusion, to change our country, every institution must reform itself. Our nation will progress when we move\nAnd, we expect you to lead from the front in expenditure reforms or clean energy and energy efficiency.\nAs you improve, we will do our best to meet your needs.\nAs our economy grows, we will be able to secure ourselves better.\nIn turn, India pursues its dreams in the comfort that it is safe in your hands.\nOur military leaders,\nThis is a year of anniversaries of the World War and our 1965 conflict.\nThis is also a year when humanity has come together in the United Nations to combat poverty and climate change.\nIn the memories of the great tragedies of the past and in our united efforts for a better world, we are reminded of the enduring human story of progress and peril.\nAnd, of the responsibilities that men and women in uniform bear To serve the cause of peace To become the sender\nI know that our forces live by that creed. For our nation, for our friends, and our world\nAnd, you will help\nThank you."
