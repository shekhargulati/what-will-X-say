By 1945, they included 25 million men of the Indian Army, the largest volunteer force in history More than 24000 lost their lives and nearly half of that went missing.\nThe legacy of that sacrifice is shared by three countries present here. They remain the largest contributors to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.\nOver 180,000 Indian troops have participated in UN peacekeeping missions - more than any other country India has participated in 48 of the 69 UN peacekeeping missions so far. 161 Indian peacekeepers have made the supreme sacrifice while serving in UN missions.\nIndia was the first country to contribute a Female Formed Police Unit to UN Mission in Liberia.\nIndia has been providing training to peacekeeping officers Till date, we have trained about 800 officers from 82 countries.\nI thank President Obama for hosting this Summit on Peacekeeping. It is the only time of the 70th anniversary of the organization. It is also known as the security environment is changing, the demands on peacekeeping are growing and the resources are hard to find.\nToday's peacekeepers are called upon only to maintain peace and security, but also address a range of complex challenges.\nMandates are ambitious; But, the resources are often inadequate. Mandates sometimes make peacekeepers party to conflicts, putting their lives and success of their missions.\nThe problems arise to a large extent, because the countries in the country do not have a role in the decision-making process. They do not have enough representation in senior management and as Force Commander\nPeacekeeping missions should be deployed in prudently, with full recognition of their limitations and in support of political solutions.\nWe are happy that the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations has recognized the issues. We thank the UN General Secretary for his prompt report on the Panel's recommendations. We look forward to their early consideration.\nIndia's commitment to UN peacekeeping is strong and will grow.\nWe have announced new purpose contributions to the UN Peacekeeping Operations\nThese include additional battalion of up to 850 troops in existing or new operations; additional 03 police units with higher representation of female peacekeepers; commitment to provide critical enablers; deployment of technical personnel in UN missions; And, additional training for peacekeepers at our facilities in India and in the field.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize that the success of UN peacekeeping ultimately depends on the weapons that the soldiers carry, but on the noral force that the UN Security Council command.\nWe must complete the long-pending task of reforms within a fixed time frame of the UN Security Council to protect the relevance and effectiveness of the UN.\nI would like to pay homage to the peacekeepers who have laid down their lives in the United Nations. It will be the most fitting if the proposed peacekeepers is created quickly India stands ready to contribute, including financially, to this objective"
