Damodaram\nDistinguished Delegates\nLadies and Gentlemen\nI am happy to start the new year with distinguished scientists from home and abroad in the holy city of Tirupati.\nI am happy to inaugurate this 104th session of The Indian Science Congress in the panoramic campus of Sri Venkateswara University.\nAnd I appreciate the Indian Science Congress Association for choosing a suitable theme \"Science \u0026 Technology for National Development\" for this year's session.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nThe nation will always be grateful to the scientists who have worked tirelessly to empower our society by their vision, labor, and leadership.\nIn November 2016, the country lost one such eminent scientist and institution builder, Dr. M.G.K. Menon I join you in tribute\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\nThe speed and scale of changes we encounter today is unprecedented.\nHow are we going to respond to these challenges that we can not even know? It is a deep-rooted curiosity-driven scientific tradition that allows quick adaptation to new realities.\nTomorrow's experts will come from our people and infrastructure. My government is committed to supporting different streams of scientific knowledge; ranging from fundamental science to applied science with emphasis on innovations.\n\nDistinguished Delegates\nIn the last two sessions of science congress, I presented before you several key challenges and opportunities for the nation.\nSome of these important challenges are in the key sectors of clean water \u0026 energy, food, environment, climate, security, and healthcare.\nWe need to keep the eye on the rise of disruptive technologies. We need to clarify the challenges and opportunities for our technology.\nI have been told that Technology Vision 2035 document released in last year's Science Congress, is now developing into a detailed roadmap for twelve key technology sectors. Further, NIITI is developing a holistic science and technology vision for the country.\nOne important area that needs to be addressed is the rapid global rise of Cyber-Physical Systems. This has the potential to pose unprecedented challenges and our demographic dividend. But we can turn it into a huge opportunity by research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis, deep learning, quantum communication and Internet-of-Things.\nThere is a need to develop and exploit these technologies in services and manufacturing sectors; in agriculture, water, energy \u0026 traffic management; health, environment, infrastructure and Geo Information Systems; security; financial systems and in combating crime\nWe need to develop an Inter-Ministerial National Mission in the Cyber-Physical System to secure our future.\nDistinguished Delegates\nThe oceans that surround the Indian peninsula have over thirteen hundred of our islands They also give us a seven and a half thousand kilometer coastline and 2.4 million square kilometer of Exclusive Economic Zone.\nThey contain enormous opportunities in energy, food, medicine and a host of other natural resources. The ocean economy should be a significant dimension of our sustainable future.\nI am told, that the Ministry of Earth Sciences is working to launch a Deep Ocean Mission in Explore, understand and harness this resource in a responsible way. This could be a transformative step for the prosperity and security of the nation.\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\nOur best science and technology organizations should further strengthen their basic research in line with leading global standards. Translating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth.\nSCOPUS database indicates that India now ranks sixth in the world with respect to scientific publishing, growing at a rate of about 14 percent as the world average growth rate of about four percent. I am sure that our scientists will further meet the challenges of enhanced quality of basic research, its technology translation and its social connect.\nBy 2030 India will be among the top three countries in science and technology and will be the best talent in the world. The wheels we set in motion\nDistinguished Delegates,\nScience should meet India fully appreciates the role of social needs We must address the problems of urban-rural divide and work for inclusive development, economic growth and employment generation. To enable this, there is a need for a new overarching structure that will be coordinated with all relevant stakeholders.\nOur ability to mount and execute large, transformational national missions require effective partnerships that integrate with a large stakeholder base. The effectiveness of these missions can be ensured only by getting our deep rooted silos, and a collaborative approach to adoption, which is our multifarious development challenges rapidly and effectively. Our ministries, our scientists, R \u0026 D institutions, industries, start-ups, universities and IITs, all should work together seamlessly. In particular, our infrastructure and socio-economic ministries should be used.\nOur Institutions may consider inviting outstanding scientists from abroad including NRIs for long term research associations. We should include foreign and NRI PhD students in post-doctoral research in our projects.\nAnother empowering factor for the delivery If we want science to deliver, we should not constrain it\nBuilding a strong Science and Technology infrastructure that is accessible to academia, start-ups, industry and R \u0026 D labs is a priority of the government. We need to address the problems of ease of access, maintenance, redundancy and duplication of expensive equipments in our Scientific Institutions. The desirability of establishing professionally managed, large regional centers in PPP mode\nOn the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility, the concept of Scientific Social Responsibility needs to be inculcated to connect our students to all leading stakeholders, including schools and colleges. We will create an environment for sharing ideas and resources.\nThe brightest and best in every corner of India should have the opportunity to excel in science. This will ensure that our youth get high-end training exposure to the best of science and technology.\nTo this end, I would request the National Laboratories to connect with schools and colleges. This will also help with our vast scientific and technological infrastructure.\nLaboratories, Research Institutions and Universities in each major city region, should be interlinked to function on a hub and talk model. The hubs will share major infrastructure, drive our national science missions and be the engines that link discovery to application.\nCollege teachers with background in research can be connected to the neighboring universities and R \u0026 D institutions. Outreach activities from the institutions of eminence to schools, colleges and polytechnics would activate the latent Science and Technology manpower from the educational institutions in your neighborhood.\nDistinguished delegates,\nSeeding the power of ideas and innovation in schoolchildren will broaden the base of our innovation pyramid and secure the future of our nation As a step in this direction, the Ministry of Science \u0026 Technology is introducing a program for students of classes 6 to 10.\nThe program will scout, mentor, reward and showcase ten lakh top innovative ideas on local needs from 5 lakh schools\nWe must provide equal opportunities to the girl child in enrollment and excel in the under-represented disciplines of science and engineering and the continuing participation of trained women scientists in nation building.\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\nFor a large and diverse country like India, technology needs to span a wide range; from advanced space, nuclear and defense technologies to rural development needs in providing clean water, sanitation, renewable energy, community health, etc.\nWhile we excel globally, we also need to develop local solutions that fit our unique context.\nThere is a need to develop appropriate Micro-Industry models for the rural areas that use local resources and the local needs and generate local industries.\nFor example, we should develop a host of technologies based on efficient co-generation for clusters of villages and semi-urban areas. These technologies should be used to convert agricultural and bio-waste to satisfy multiple needs of electricity, clean water, crop-processing and cold storage.\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\nThe role of science in planning, decision making, and governance\nWe need to develop and deploy geo-information systems to meet the goals of our citizens, Gram Panchayats, Districts and States. A coordinated effort by the Survey of India, ISRO and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.\nFor sustainable development, we must take strong measures to focus on waste management in the critical areas of electronic waste, biomedical and plastic waste, and solid waste and waste water solutions.\nWe are scaling up R \u0026 D on clean carbon technologies, technologies for enhancement of energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy.\nFocus on sustainable development Our strong scientific community can also address our unique challenges. For example, can we find the problem of crop burning? Can we redesign our brick kilns for reduced emissions and greater energy efficiency?\nScience and Technology is a key factor in the Startup India program launched in January 2016. Two other strong initiatives are the Atal Innovation Mission and NIDHI - The National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations. These programs focus on an innovation driven enterprise ecosystem. Further, public-private partnerships with CII, FICCI and high technology private companies are being promoted to the innovation ecosystem.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nOur Scientists have contributed strongly to the strategic vision of the nation.\nThe Indian space program has put India in the top space faring nations We have achieved a high degree of self-sufficiency in space technology, including launch vehicle development, payload and satellite building, applications for development and the ability of core competence and capacity.\nThe Defense Research \u0026 Development Organization has played the role of a force multiplier for the Armed Forces with its systems and technologies.\nWe are leveraging strategic international partnerships and collaborations based on the principles of mutuality, parity and reciprocity, to make Indian Science globally competitive. We are also placing special emphasis on building strong relationships with our neighbors and multilateral fora such as BRICS. The best of global science is helping us unravel creation's mysteries and develop cutting-edge technologies Last year, we activated the 3.6 meter optical telescope in Devasthal in Uttarakhand made Indo-Belgian collaboration. Recently, we approved the LIGO project with USA to build a state-of-the-art detector system in India.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate that the government is committed to providing the best support to our Scientists and Scientific Institutions.\nI am sure that our scientists will scale up their efforts from the quality of basic science to technology development to innovation.\nLet Science and Technology become a strong tool of inclusive development and betterment of the weakest and poorest segments of our society.\nTogether, we will prevail to make a fair, equitable and prosperous nation.\nJai hind\nNation will always be grateful to scientists who have worked tirelessly to empower our society by their vision, labor, and leadership: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nTomorrow's experts will come in investments we make in our people and infrastructure: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/Iy8hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nGovernment is committed to supporting different streams of scientific knowledge: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nRanging from fundamental science to applied science with emphasis on innovations: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nWe need to keep an eye on the rise of disruptive technologies and be prepared for leverage them for growth: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nOne important area that needs to be addressed is the rapid global rise of Cyber-Physical Systems: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/Iy8hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nThere is a need to develop and exploit these technologies in services and manufacturing sectors: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nOur best science and technology organizations should further strengthen their basic research in line with leading global standards: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nTranslating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nScience must meet the expectations of our people: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nAnother empowering factor for the delivery If we want science to deliver, we should not constrain it: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nOn the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility, the concept of Scientific Social Responsibility needs to be inculcated (1/2)\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nto connect our leading organizations to all stakeholders, including schools and colleges: PM @narendramodi (2/2)\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nThe brightest and best in every corner of India should have the opportunity to excel in science: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nSeeding the power of ideas \u0026 innovation in schoolchildren will broaden the base of our innovation pyramid \u0026 secure future of our nation: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nThe role of science in planning, decision making and governance has never been more important: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nOur scientists have contributed strongly to the strategic vision of the nation: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2017\nThe Government is committed to providing the best support to our scientists and scientific institutions: PM @narendramodi"
