the Persian, Central Asian and Caucasian lands; the region of East Asia; and, with Buddhism and Indian philosophy and science\nAs it enriched itself, it also enriched the world\nIt sets, once again, an enduring lesson of human history: it is through openness and inquiry, engagement and accommodation, and respect for diversity that humanity advances, nations progress and the world prospers.\nAnd, this is the message of Sufism, one of the greatest contributions of Islam to this world.\nFrom its origins in Egypt and West Asia, Sufism travelled to distant lands, holding aloft the banner of human values, learning from spiritual cultures of other civilizations, and attracting people with their saints of life and message.\nIn the different settings of Saharan Africa or in South East Asia, in Turkey or in Central Asia, in Iran or India, Sufism is the universal human desire to be practiced and the religion of precepts beyond the Almighty with a deep unity.\nAnd, in that spiritual and mystical inquiry, Sufis experienced the universal message of Almighty:\nThat perfection in human life is reflected in the qualities that are dear to God.\nThat all are creations of God; And, that if we love God, we must also love all his creations.\nAs Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya said, \"Almighty holds those people who love him for human beings, and those who love human beings for the sake of Almighty.\"\nThis is the message of the Almighty's creations.\nFor the Sufis, therefore, service to God meant service to humanity\nIn the words of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, of all worships, the worship that pleases the Almighty God is the most humble and oppressed\nIn a beautiful imagery of human values, he said, human beings must have the love of the sun, the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth, because they benefit us all, without discrimination and distinction in people\nAnd, its humanism also stands out in women and society.\nAbove all, Sufism is a celebration of diversity and pluralism, expressed in the words of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, that every people has its own path of truth, beliefs and focus of reverence.\nThese words reflect the divine message to the Holy Prophet that there is no compulsion in religion; And also those that are observed\nAnd, it is in harmony with the soul of the Bhakti saint's saying in the Hindu tradition, \"Into the bosom of a great sea, flow streams that come from hills on every side\"\nAnd in the wisdom of Bulleh Shah, \"Lord is mixed in every heart.\"\nThese values ​​are the need of our times\nThis is the reality of Nature. We learn this wisdom in the perfect balance and harmony that exists in the vast diversity of a forest.\nIts message is beyond the confines of schools and sects. It's a spiritual quest that traces its origination from the Holy Prophet and the fundamental values ​​of Islam, which literally means peace.\nAnd, it reminds us that when we think of the 99 names of Allah, none stand for force and violence, and that the first two names denote compassionate and merciful. Allah is Rahman and Raheem\nSufism is the voice of peace, co-existence, compassion and equality; a call to universal brotherhood\nAnd, just as India became a principal center of Islamic civilization, our nation also emerged as one of the most vibrant hubs of Sufism.\nSufism became the face of Islam in India, even as it remained deeply rooted in the Holy Quran, and Hadis.\nSufism blossomed in India's openness and pluralism. It engaged with her spiritual tradition, and evolved its own Indian ethos.\nAnd, it helped shape a distinct Islamic heritage of India.\nWe see this heritage in the fields of art, architecture and culture that is part of the fabric of our nation and our collective daily lives.\nWe see it in the spiritual and intellectual tradition of India.\nIt helped strengthen the inclusive culture that is the great nation of immense contribution to the world.\nIn Baba Farid's poetry or Guru Granth Sahib, we feel the same spiritual connection.\nWe see compassion in the langars of Sufi shrines and the village of the pirates that attracted the poor and hungry;\nThe words of the Sufi Khanqahs\nSufism's contribution to India is huge. Its effect on the music\nAmir Khusrau Eight centuries later, his poetry and musical innovation continued to be the soul of Hindustani music. No one had spoken\nWho else did not express love for India?\n\"But India, from head to toe, is a picture of heaven,\nAdam came from the palace of paradise,\nHe could only be sent to an orchard of fruits\nIf India is not Paradise, how can they be made of the peacock, the bird of paradise?\nIt is the spirit of Sufism, the love for their country and the pride in their nation that defines the Muslims in India.\nThey are the timeless culture of peace, diversity and equality of our land;\nThey are steeped in the democratic tradition of India, confident of their place in the country and invested in their nation;\nAnd, above all, they are shaped by the Islamic heritage of India. It upholds the highest ideals of Islam and has always denied the forces of terrorism and extremism.\nNow, as they travel to different parts of the world, they are the ambassadors of the nations.\nAs a nation, we stand against colonialism and in our struggle for freedom.\nAt the dawn of independence; And, I believe, that too was the colonial politics of that time.\nThe tallest of our leaders, such as Maulana Azad, and important spiritual leaders, such as Maulana Hussain Madani, and millions and millions of ordinary citizens, rejected the idea of ​​religion.\nNow, India is moving forward on the strength of the struggles, the sacrifices, the bravery, the knowledge, the skill, the art and the pride of every faith in our diverse and yet united nation.\nLike the strings of sitar that each produces a note, but come together to create a beautiful melody.\nThis is the spirit of India This is the strength of our nation.\nAll our people, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists, the micro-minority of pararsis, believers, non-believers, are the integral part of India.\nJust as it once came to India, today Sufism from India\nBut, this tradition that developed in India is the whole of South Asia.\nThat is why I urge others in the region to nurture and revive this glorious heritage of ours.\nWhen the spiritual love of Sufism, not the violent force of terrorism, flows across the border, this region will be the paradise on earth that Amir Khusrau spoke about.\nLet me paraphrase what I have said before: Terrorism divides and destroys us\nIndeed, when terrorism and extremism have become the most destructive force of our times, the message of Sufism has global relevance.\nIn the centers of conflict in West Asia to calm cities in distant countries, in the remote villages of Africa to the cities in our own region, terrorism is a daily threat.\nEvery day brings us horrible news and horrifying images:\n• of schools turned into graveyards of innocence;\n• of prayer gatherings turned into funeral harvestions,\n• of call to prayer or azan drowned by the sound of explosion;\n• of blood on the beach, massacres in malls and smouldering cars on streets;\n• of thriving cities ruined and priceless heritage destroyed;\n• And, of parents bearing coffins, whole communities dislocated, millions of displaced, and refugees caught between fire and stormy seas\nIn the digital century of new war and opportunities, the reach of terror is growing and its toll is increasing every year.\nSince the beginning of this century, tens of thousands of families have lost their loved ones in thousands of terrorist incidents globally\nLast year alone, I am talking about 2015, over 90 countries experienced terrorists. Parents in 100 countries live with the daily pain of their children\nAnd, in a globally mobile world, one incident can claim citizens of many nations\nEvery year, we spend 100 billion dollars on securing the world from terrorism, money that should have been spent on building life of the poor.\nThe effect It is changing in the way we live\nThere are forces and groups that are of the state policy and design. There are others to be misguided.\nThere are some who are trained in organized camps. There are those who find their inspiration in the cyber space.\nTerrorism uses different motivations and causes, none of which can be justified\nTerrorists distort a religion\nThey kill and destroy more in their own land and their own people than they do elsewhere\nAnd, they are putting the whole regions to peril and making the world more insecure and violent.\nThe fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion. It can not be\nIt is a struggle between the values ​​of humanism and the forces of inhumanity.\nIt is not a conflict to be fought only through intelligence, or diplomatic means\nIt is also a battle that should be won through the strength of our values ​​and the real message of religions.\nAs I have said before, we will reject any link between terrorism and religion. Those who spread terror in the name of religion are anti-religious.\nAnd, we must advance the message of Sufism that stands for the principles of Islam and the highest human values.\nThis is a task that states, societies, sages, scholars and families must pursue.\nHowever, to me, the message of Sufism is not just confined to combating terrorism.\nThe values ​​of harmony, welfare, compassion and love for human beings are the foundation of a just society.\nThat is the principle behind my creed of \"Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikaas\".\nAnd, these values ​​are important to preserve and nurture diversity in our societies.\nDiversity is a basic reality and source of richness of a society; And, it should not be a cause of discord\nWe need just not constitutional provisions or legal safeguards, but also social values ​​to build an inclusive and peaceful society, in which everyone is safe, about his rights and confidence of his future.\nThis is also a time of great flux and transition in the world. The middle of the last A new world order emerged. Many new countries were born\nAt the beginning of a new century, we are still a point of view.\nIn many parts of the world, there is uncertainty about the future, and how to deal with it as nations and societies.\nThese are precisely the times that the world is the most vulnerable to violence and conflicts.\nThe global community must be more vigilant than ever before and counter the forces of darkness with human values.\nSo, let us remember the teaching of Holy Quran that if someone slew a innocent person, it would be as if he slew a whole people; if anyone saved one life, it would be as if he saved a whole people\nLet us be inspired by the message of Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti,\nWith your spiritual light, dissolve the clouds of disorder and war and spread goodwill, peace, and harmony among the people.\nLet us remember the infinite humanism in Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi's words, \"Contain all human faces in your own, without any judgment of them.\"\nLet us also live the sermon of Bible that calls us to do good, seek peace and pursue it.\nAnd, oneness in Kabir's observation that a river and its waves are one\nAnd, Guru Nanak Devji's prayer that Lord, may everybody prosper and be in peace\nLet us be inspired by Swami Vivekananda's appeal against divisions and people of all religions to hold the harmony, not of dispute.\nLet us also reaffirm the enduring message of Ahimsa of Lord Buddha and Mahavira.\nAnd, from this forum, in this land of Gandhi,\nAnd, of timeless prayers\nOm Shanti; Shanti; Shanti: Peace, Peace, Peace; Peace within and in the world\nLet us, therefore, send a message to the world:\n• A melody of harmony and humanity\n• The embrace of diversity, the spirit of aneness\n• Of service with compassion and generosity,\n• A resolve against terrorism, a rejection of extremism\n• And, a determination to advance peace\nLet us challenge the forces of violence with our love and universal human values.\nAnd lastly, let us revert to the light of hope and turn.\nThank you for being here Thank you for what you stand for Thank you for the role of a better world. Thank you very much, Thanks a lot\n"
