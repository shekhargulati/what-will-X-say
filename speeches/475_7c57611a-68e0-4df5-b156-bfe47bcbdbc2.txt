This feeling from me to me, from the key to the age, this expansion, this is Yoga.\nThis journey, as a natural by-product, brings the benefits of good health, peace of mind, and even, prosperity in life.\nYoga makes the person a better person in thought, action, knowledge and devotion.\nIt will be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.\nYoga is far beyond physical exercises\nThe quest for peace comes from modern life, often drives people to tobacco, alcohol, or even drugs.\nYoga offers a timeless, simple, and healthy alternative. There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps fight stress and chronic lifestyle-related conditions.\nThe world today, is also threatened by the twin challenges - terrorism, and climate change\nThe world looks to India, and to Yoga, for a durable, and sustainable answer to these problems.\nWhen we talk about global peace, That is possible only Only peaceful families Only peaceful people can make peaceful families Yoga is the way to create such a harmony and peace within individuals, family, society, nation and ultimately all over the world.\nThrough Yoga, we will create a new Yuga - a Yuga of togetherness and harmony.\nWhen we talk about the combating climate change, we want to move from a lifestyle of consumption, or \"Bhoga\", to one of Yoga.\nYoga can prove to be a strong pillar and a development.\nAt a time, when the emphasis is on personal gain, and what one may get out of any endeavor, Yoga offers a refreshingly different approach\nYoga is not about what one It is about who can give up, what one can get rid of\nTherefore, instead of attainment, Yoga shows us the path to liberation, or salvation, as it is in this part of the world.\nSwami Chidanand Saraswati ji, through his work at Parmarth Niketan has shown a way to live on these noble ideals.\nI appreciate the work being done by Parmarth Niketan in bringing\nI recall the active role by Swami ji, in compiling the 11 volume Encyclopaedia of Hinduism\nRemarkably, Swamiji and his team have accomplished this mission in less than a quarter of a century. And the depth of their work is amazing\nThey were able to include almost all aspects of Hinduism in only 11 volumes.\nThis is indeed a possession that can benefit every spiritual seeker, yogi, and even a common person\nWorks like Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, when made available in various languages, increase the under-standing and enhancing awareness of the other traditions and cultures in the country.\nThis increased under-standing, in turn, reduces hatred, misunderstanding and increased cooperation, peace and amity among communities.\nLet me also take this opportunity, to compliment Parmarth Niketan, for the active role played them in the Clean India Mission - Clean India towards a mass movement.\nIndian customs have a strong emphasis on personal hygiene. Not only is keeping one's body clean and pure emphasized, but also the cleanliness in one's house, place of work and place of worship.\nAccumulation of any form of waste or filth within the four walls of these places is considered impure.\nEven in our ancient scriptures, this is important for personal hygiene.\nThere is, however, a tendency to dump dirt in open spaces.\nThis is not true for Western and other developed countries, where the link between community hygiene and public health is more clearly understood.\nAwareness and observance of hygiene of public goods like water bodies, land and air is crucial.\nTherefore, good health is a collective effort of personal well-being and environmental well-being.\nThrough the Swachh Bharat Mission, we are trying to establish the link between community hygiene and personal health.\nHistorically temples have played a key role in our societies\nUsually they were built on a vast area of ​​land, and often away from the residential areas.\nHowever, with passage of time, they were surrounded by markets, and residential colonies. And so, they face unclean surroundings as a major challenge\nSwachh Bharat Mission, therefore, is now included in the project \"Swachh Iconic Places\" to address this issue.\nIn the first phase, we have taken Kamakhya Temple, Jagannath Puri, Meenakshi Temple, Tirupati, Golden Temple, and Vaishno Devi Temple for making them and their surroundings clean.\nAnd so, Swachh Bharat Mission - the quest for clean India - is linked to religion and spiritualuality in the country.\nWe were all witness to the great global upsurge for Yoga when, in September 2014, I proposed an International Day of Yoga, the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nI must confess, I did not imagine the spontaneous outpouring of support that followed.\nAn unprecedented number of countries from across the world, joined hands with us\nAnd now, every year, on the occasion of Summer Solstice - June 21 - The world comes together, for Yoga.\nThe coming together of so many nations to mark the International Day of Yoga illustrates the real essence of Yoga - togetherness.\nYoga has the potential to start a new yuga (a new era) - a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nMay the blessings of the mighty Himalayas be with you\nMay you find fulfillment and bliss, in this great festival of yoga, on the banks of the river Ganga, where our sages and rishis have meditated for millennia.\nMay you enjoy your stay in the spiritual city of Rishikesh, and the divine surroundings of Parmarth Niketan.\nMay Yoga be one and all\nI wish the International Yoga Festival a grand success.\nThank you. Thank you very much\n\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 2, 2017\nThere is ample evidence that practicing Yoga helps fight and life-style related issues: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 2, 2017\nThrough Yoga, we will create a new yuga of togetherness \u0026 harmony: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 2, 2017\nI appreciate the work being done by @ParmarthNiketan in bringing us closer to people: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 2, 2017\nI wish that the @IntlYogaFest becomes a great success: PM @narendramodi"
