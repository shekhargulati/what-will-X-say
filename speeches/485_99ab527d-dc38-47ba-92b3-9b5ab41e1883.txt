Greetings to everyone.\nSwami Nirvinananda ji and all the devotees of Sri Sri Thakur Ramakrishna Paramhansa assembled here today, greetings.\nI am privileged to be present among you at the beginning of the 7 day session of Shri Ramakrishna Vachanamrita Satram.\nWhen I think of a great mind from Bengal, translated into Malayalam, being read and debated in Kerala, I am humbled by how many people have shared and adapted across our country.\nWhat could be a better example of Ek Bharat ... Shreshtha Bharat?\nThis practice is that you have started builds on a long tradition of the teachings of the scriptures, the words of the great people available to the common people.\nThis is part of the long oral tradition of India that keeps on changing the times and circumstances.\nThis tradition has evolved from the Shrutis to the Smritis.\nThe shrutis, the four Vedas and Upanishads are the source of religion: they are sacred knowledge transmitted by great Indian sages from generation to generation.\nShrutis are believed to reveal divine knowledge, transmitted orally\nSmriti is a class of texts that are based on memory and interpretation.\nSince the Vedas and the Upanishads were difficult to understand for common people, the smritis were written, explain, and clarified through the primary revelation through stories and moral lessons.\nThus it is clear that the epics, Puranas and the Arthasastra of Kautilya are all smritis.\nThe effort is to reach the people.\nTo reach the common people, there was a need to make religion, or right living, more accessible, closer to their daily lives.\nThe Bhagvat describes Devarshi Narada, singing the praise of God\nHe is the son of Lord Hanuman.\nGyanamadyanidin tantriya ramaitatur jagat ..\n'Hey! These are Devshi Naradiji, who are playing Veena, singing Hari Guna and being happy, keeps on celebrating this miserable world. '\nThe Bhakti saints used music, poetry, local languages ​​to bring God - they broke the barriers of caste, class, religion and gender.\nThe message of the saints was carried forward by folk singers, The Katha-vachak, the dastangois.\nKabir's dohas, Meera's Bhajans were carried by singers from village to village.\nIndia is a land that is blessed with a rich cultural and intellectual milieu.\nOur land is home to writers, scholars, saints and seers who have expressed themselves freely and fearlessly.\nAnd when the history of human civilization has entered the era of knowledge, India has shown the way.\nA false perception was created about India that India needs social, political and economic reform initiated by outsiders.\nThis is a reason to justify colonialism too\nSuch notions were completely false because India's soil is that soil from where it has always originated.\nAnd this change originated from within, driven by our saints and seers who made it their mission to transform society and mass movements to eradicate evils that have resulted in our society.\nOur Saints integrated each and every citizen in their quest for social reform.\nNobody was left outside the ambit.\nThis is why our civilization stands tall, overcoming obstacles\nThose civilizations that did not change with time\nWe, on the other hand even altered practices over centuries.\nSome practices have been prevalent in some centuries ago but if it was feeling redundant, it was changed.\nWe have\nThrough our history, our Saints did things that may seem small but their effect was big and this changed our history course\nLong before any faith, any culture, India had women who took up the issue of gender equality.\nThey have written boldly and expressed themselves through their powerful writings.\nIn Hindu philosophy, time is accepted as a very important factor of the absolute - we are Dik-Kaal-Baadhit - conditioned by space and time.\nThe role of the Guru is interpreting the eternal values ​​in the context of the times - so that, like a river that flows, and renews itself as it flows, the stream of knowledge is ever fresh and vibrant.\nThe Scriptures say:\nMotivational: Indicators and viewers.\nTeacher speaks for the sake of understanding: Smriti:\nThose who inspire you, who are they to tell you, they are all you gurus\nWe all remember the role of Mr. Narayana Guru in transforming Kerala.\nA saint and social reformer from a backward caste who transcended the barriers of caste and promoted social justice.\nWhen the Sivagiri pilgrimage started, he announced his goals to be promoted to education, cleanliness, devotion to God, organization, agriculture, trade, handicrafts, and technical training.\nCould there be a better example of a teacher setting standards for the advancement of society?\nSpeaking of Sri Ramakrishna in this gathering may seem like being coals to Newcastle, but I can not stop myself from mentioning those attributes that make him so relevant to present times\nHe was a part of the tradition of Bhakti saints and in the Kathamrit we found many references to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu - his trances, his songs, his utter devotion.\nBut he renewed the tradition and made it strong\nHe broke the mental barriers that keep separations between religions, between castes.\nHe was the saint of social harmony.\nHis message is that tolerance, of devotion, of surrendering oneself to the divine of One Lord with different names - the gyaani, the yogi, and the devotee. \"The same Being whom gyaanis call Brahma - the Absolute, is called Atma - Universal soul, by yogis, and Bhagavan - devotees by personal God with divine attributes.\nHe lived the Muslim way of life, he practiced\nHe found out that he was not the only one, but he did not know what to do.\n\"The Reality is one and the same;\" He said, \"The difference is in name and form.\"\n\"It is like water, called different languages ​​by different names, such as jal, neer, pani, and so forth.\nLikewise, in German it is' Wasser ', the French call it' Eau ',' Acqua in Italian, 'Mizu' in Japanese.\nIn Kerala you call it 'Vellam.'\nAll of them denote one and the same thing\nIn the same way, some address the reality as 'Allah', some as 'God', some as 'Brahma', some as 'Kali', and others by 'Ram', 'Jesus', 'Durga' 'Hari.' \"\nHis teachings are especially relevant to us today, when we are confronted with people who use religion, caste to divide and create animosity.\nMahatma Gandhi said: Ramakrishna's life enables us to face God face to face.\nNo one can read the story of his life without being convinced that God alone is real and that all else is a illusion\nSri Ramakrishna is a link between the ancient and the modern\nHe has also been shown to be the ideal of life.\nSimple anecdotes, simple messages - told simply\nBut due to their very simplicity, they were embedded in the minds of the listeners.\nIf we did not like a disciple like Swami Vivekananda?\nThe great karmayogi took the thought of his Guru -\nJatra Jeev, Tatra Shiva - Where there is a living being, there is Shiva;\nand\nJeeve Daya Noy, Shiv Gyaane Jeev Seba - Jeeva Daya Nooy, Shiva Knowledgeable Jiva Seba \"- not the kindness to living beings, but serving the living being as Shiva Himself -\nto his life\nSwami Vivekananda said - Where should you go to seek God?\nAre not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, god? Why not worship them first? Let these people be your God\nHis clarion call - \"Now is wanted intense Karma-Yoga with un-bounded courage and indomitable strength in the heart. Then only the people of the country be roused \"\n- continues to give us courage\nRamakrishna's record of service\nWe find the mission in poor areas, in tribals, in areas, distressed by need or disaster trying to alleviate suffering.\nIt does not matter what the person is from, what her caste or beliefs are.\nAll that is important is that he or she can be helped through selfless service.\nOn the website of the Mission,\nWe find the brahmvakya- Self-realization\nFor one's own salvation and for the welfare of the world\nService Parmo Dharma:\nShiva Saiamannu Charam World\n(We should always serve the motherland which was adopted by religion)\nFriendship friendship Pleasure and Punishment Issues Vanuttitaprasadam\n(Seeing the sadness of the other person, seeing the compassion of others, the virtue of the second seeing the social service, etc., and if someone committed a sin, then the neglect in the mind would be 'leave the' attitudes.\nThe flame that has been lit today - the satram that has begun- should be illuminate our hearts - burning from a lamp second, burning lamp thousand.\nTo quote our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji:\nCome, burn the lamp again\nDark in the afternoon\nThe sun shines with shadow\nSqueeze Nehru of the innermost-\nSolve the extinguished wick.\nLet's burn the lamp again.\nLet Sri Sri Thakur, Ramakrishna's words inspire us to see the divine in all things, to harness self and the ego in the service of the poorest and weakest, so that we find greater truth that all the religions of essence.\nAgain, it is the words of the great disciple that I will take as my guide: let us work on, doing as we go, and our shoulders to the wheel\nThen will we see the Light!\nThank you.
