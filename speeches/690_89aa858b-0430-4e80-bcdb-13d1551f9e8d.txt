On the first visit of Prime Minister Oli Ji after assuming the post, I warmly welcome him, and the whole delegation of Nepal. I express my heartfelt condolences to the wonderful love and goodwill of Nepal's glorious people towards India. At the same time, I respect the expectations and aspirations of Nepalese citizens; and also respect their awareness and discretion. On this occasion, I also pay homage to late Sushil Koirala, the late leader of Nepal. His contributions will always be remembered for his friendship in Nepal-Nepal Friendship.\nFriends,\nIndia and Nepal are two sovereign states. The friendship of these is close and unpredictable. The integrity of the Himalaya and the sanctity of the Ganges are witnesses of our strong relationship. The open gates of the boundaries define the mutual relations of our people. We have shared successors of a wealthy culture and tradition. Peace, stability and economic development in Nepal are our common intention. On all these aspects of Indo-Nepal relations, I and Prime Minister Oli spoke in detail today.\nExcellency Oli,\nThe whole world believes that in the last few years, Nepal has made commendable progress on the path of democracy and federalism. After decades of conflict, the constitution of Nepal and its announcement is an important achievement. I congratulate the Government of Nepal and the political leadership in its construction, and the contributions made by all the sections of society. But its success depends on the consent and communication. I believe that on the basis of these principles, through political dialogue, taking all sections of Nepal together, you will take all the issues related to Nepal's constitution satisfactorily and take Nepal on the path of progress and stability.\nFriends,\nIndia's permanent interest in Nepal's economic growth, development and prosperity. Our resources and institutions have always been a positive tool to fulfill this purpose of Nepal and will remain in future also. In this context, India's economic progress can be an easiest way for Nepal's prosperity. Transport corridors between the two countries can become highways of development. In view of this, the agreed agreement on opening two more transit points between our countries is important. The opening of these transit points will also strengthen regional economic development and connectivity. During my visit to Nepal, I said that Nepal's hydro power potential can illuminate not only the whole of Nepal, but also fulfill India's energy needs.\nI am happy that Nepal and India are working on several hydro power projects. The total capacity of these is about 7000 mega watts. The rapid and successful construction of these projects can become a major road for Nepal's economic prosperity. The Muzaffarpur-Dhalkewar Transmission line, which we have just inaugurated, will provide about 80-MW power to Nepal immediately. In the next two years, this line will provide 600-MW power to Nepal.\nFriends,\nTrade and investment are the strong pillars of our relations. These can be made more powerful. For this, early manufacture of integrated check posts is in the interest of both countries. Agreement on road construction in the Terai area of ​​Nepal will further strengthen trade infrastructure. Last year, Nepal had faced the tragedy caused by a severe earthquake. The disaster came to Nepal, but every Indian also suffered pain. For the fulfillment of the requirements of Nepal's reconstruction after the earthquake, India had announced a one-billion-dollar assistance package.In this area, two expeditions today, one US $ 250 million grant, and another US $ 750 The million line of credit will take our participation further. In this context, the Prime Minister of Oli will prove beneficial in the work of post-earthquake reconstruction of Bhuj pilgrim.\nExcellency Oli,\nAyurveda is an effective part of India's ancient civilization, whose impression is also strong in today's era. Nepal is also closely linked to Ayurveda. Ayurveda expansion in Nepal is in the cultural and business interests of the two countries. If Nepal wants, India can open Ayurvedic colleges in Nepal. They can be linked to the Ayurvedic Universities of India.\nFriends,\nIt is clear that the stability of Nepal is related to India's security. Prime Minister Oli and I also agree that both the countries will meet together with the threats of increasing extremism and terrorism.We are open to the frontiers of terrorists and Do not abuse criminals In this context, security agencies of both countries will strengthen their cooperation.\nExcellency Oli,\nPeace, stability and independence in Nepal are our common interest. I and the whole of India are supporters of economic development of Nepal. India's cooperation has always been positive. The actions taken under it are in line with the priorities of the government and the people of Nepal. I am confident that India-Nepal relations will be stronger in your efficient leadership and will touch new heights. With these words, I once again welcome you and your delegation to India.\nThank you\nToday, India-Nepal is an important day of friendship history: PM begins his comments on PM Oli https://t.co/I88hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nI express my heartfelt condolences to India's incredible love and goodwill of Nepal's glorious people: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/I88hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nOn this occasion, I also pay tribute to the late leader of Nepal, Mr. Sushil Koirala: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/I88hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nWe have shared heirs of a wealthy culture and tradition: PM @narendramodi on India-Nepal ties\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nPeace, stability and economic development in Nepal are our common intention: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nIn the last few years, Nepal has made commendable progress on the path of democracy and federalism: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nIndia has lasting interest in Nepal's economic growth, development and prosperity: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/I88hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nIndia's economic progress can be a natural way of Nepal's prosperity: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/I88hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nTransport corridors can become highways of progress between our nations: PM @narendramodi on India-Nepal ties https://t.co/Iy8hu3Nre5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 20, 2016\nTrade and investment are the strong pillars of our relations.
