I am happy\nThis Parliament represents one of Asia's oldest democracies; And, one of its most vibrant.\nLong before many others in the world, Sri Lanka gave everyone a vote and voice.\nTo the people of Sri Lanka, Aububan, Vanakkam.\nI bring the greetings of 1.25 billion friends; and millions of fans of Sri Lankan cricket\nI bring the blessings from the land of Bodh Gaya to the land of Anuradhapura.\nI stand here in our shared heritage; and, in commitment to our shared future\nLast May, when I took the oath of office, I was honored by the South Asian leaders at the ceremony.\nHis presence was a celebration of democracy. It was also recognized for our common destiny.\nI am convinced that the future of any country is influenced by its neighborhood.\nThe future that I dream for India is the future that I wish for our neighbors\nWe in this region are on the same tour:\nOur path will be easy, the journey quicker and destination closer.\nAs I stand here in Colombo and look north towards the Himalaya, I marvel at our region's uniqueness - of our rich variety and our common civilisational links.\nWe have been formed from the same elements; and, from our interconnected histories.\nToday, we stand together as proud nations - sovereign and equal.\nIndia and Sri Lanka do not have a land boundary, but we are the closest neighbors in every sense.\nNo matter where you look in India or Sri Lanka, the many strands of our links - religion, language, culture, food, customs, traditions and epics - come together in a deep and strong bond of familiarity and friendship\nOurs is a relationship that is beautifully defined by the journey of Mahindra and Sanghamitra. They carried the message of peace, tolerance and friendship more than two millenniums ago.\nIt is evoked by Kannagi, the central character of the great Tamil epic Silapathikaram, who is worshiped as goddess the Pattini in Sri Lanka.\nIt lives in the Ramayan trail in Sri Lanka.\nIt expresses itself in devotion at the Dargah of the Nagore Andavar and the Christian Temple of Velankanni.\nIt is reflected in the friendship of Swami Vivekananda and Anagarika Dharmapala, founder of the Maha Bodhi Society in Sri Lanka and India.\nIt lives in the work of Mahatma Gandhi's followers in India and Sri Lanka.\nAbove all, our relationship thrives through the inter-woven lives of ordinary Indians and Sri Lankans.\nOur Independent Life started at about the same time\nSri Lanka has made remarkable progress since then.\nThe nation is an inspiration for human development. Sri Lanka is home to enterprise and skill; and extraordinary intellectual heritage\nThere are businesses of global class here.\nSri Lanka is a leader in advancing cooperation in South Asia\nAnd, it is important for the future of the Indian Ocean Region.\nSri Lanka's progress and prosperity is also a source of strength for India.\nSo, Sri Lanka's success is great significance to India.\nAnd, as a friend, our good wishes, and our support and solidarity have always been Sri Lanka.\nAnd, it will always be there for you\nFor our country, our success depends on you.\nOur societies of different sections for rights and claims, of dignity and opportunity, all of us in this region, indeed every nation of diversity, has dealt with the issues of identities and inclusion.\nWe have all seen its diverse expressions We have faced tragic violence We have encountered brutal terrorism We have also seen successful examples of peaceful settlements.\nWe have received this problem in our own ways.\nHowever, I want to reconcile them\nDiversity\nWhen we accommodate the aspirations of all sections of our society, the nation gets the strength of every individual\nAnd, when we empower states, districts and villages, we make our country strong and strong\nYou can call this my bias. I have been a Chief Minister for 13 years; a Prime Minister for less than a year!\nToday, my top priority is to make the states strong in India. I am a firm believer in cooperative federalism.\nSo, we are devolving more power and more resources to the states. And, we have been successful in national decision making processes.\nSri Lanka has lived through tragic violence and conflict You have successfully defeated\nYou are now standing on a moment of historic opportunities to win hearts and heal the wounds across all sections of society.\nRecent elections in Sri Lanka have reflected the collective voice of the nation - the hope for change, reconciliation and unity.\nThe steps that you have taken in recent times are bold and admirable They represent a new beginning.\nI am confident of a future of Sri Lanka, defined by unity and integrity; peace and harmony; and, opportunity and dignity for everyone.\nI believe in Sri Lanka's ability to achieve it\nIt is rooted in our common civilizationational heritage.\nThe path ahead is a choice that Sri Lanka has made And, it is a collective responsibility of all sections of the society; And, of all political streams in the country\nBut, I can assure you of this:\nFor India, the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka is paramount.\nIt is rooted in our interest It is our own fundamental beliefs in this principle.\nHon'ble Speaker and Distinguished Members,\nMy vision of an ideal neighborhood is one in which trade, investments, technology, ideas and people flow smooth across across boundaries; When Partnerships in the Routine\nIn India, the growth momentum has been restored. India has become the fastest growing major economy in the world.\nThe world sees India as the new frontier of economic opportunity.\nBut, our neighbors should have first claim on India And I repeat, the first claim on India is our neighbors - of Sri Lanka.\nI will be happy if India serves a catalyst in our neighbors.\nIn our region, Sri Lanka has the strongest economic partner.\nWe will work with you to boost trade and make it more balanced.\nIndia's business environment is becoming growing Sri Lanka should not fall behind in this competitive world\nThat is why we conclude an ambitious Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.\nIndia can also be a natural source of investments - for exports to India and elsewhere; And to build your infrastructure We have made good progress today Let us get together the harness the vast potential of the Ocean Economy.\nOur two countries must also take the lead in growing cooperation in the South Asian Region and the linked BIMSTEC Region.\nConnecting this vast area by land and sea, our two countries can become engines of regional prosperity.\nI also assure you of India's full commitment to develop partnership with Sri Lanka. We see this as a responsibility of a friend and neighbor.\nIndia has committed 1.6 billion US dollars in development assistance Today, we have committed further assistance of up to 318 million dollars to the railway sector.\nWe will continue our development partnership We will be guided by your Government And, we'll do so with the same level of transparency that we expect in our country.\nLast month we signed the agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\nMore than anywhere else in the region, I see enormous potential to expand cooperation with Sri Lanka in areas like agriculture, education, health, science and technology, and space Indeed, we are limited only by our imagination.\nWe hope that Sri Lanka will take full advantage of India's satellite for the SAARC Region This should be in Space by December 2016.\nPeople are the heart of our relationship When we connect people, bonds between nations become strong That is why we have decided to extend the visa on the arrival facility to Sri Lankan citizens.\nWe will also connect We will strengthen ties of culture and religion Last month we announced reduction in fees for Sri Lankan nationals visiting National Museum in Delhi to see the Kapilavastu Relics We will bring our shared Buddhist heritage Together, We will develop our Buddhist and Ramayana Trails My birth place was an international center of Buddhist learning in ancient times. Excavations have revealed a hostel for 2000 students and plans to redevelop the center.\nMr Speaker,\nA future of prosperity requires a strong foundation of our countries and peace and stability in the region.\nThe security of our two countries is indivisible Equally, our shared responsibility for our marine neighborhood is clear\nIndia and Sri Lanka are too close to look away from each other. Nor can we be insulated from one other\nOur recent histories have shown that we suffer together; and we are more effective\nOur cooperation helped deal with the devastation of tsunami in 2004. As a Chief Minister, I was pleased to share our experience in reconstruction after the Bhuj earthquake in 2001.\nOur cooperation is also integral to our success in combating terrorism and extremism.\nFor both of us, local threats remain But, we see threats arising in new forms and new sources. We are witnessing globalization of terrorism. The need for our cooperation has never been stronger than today\nThe Indian Ocean is critical to the security and prosperity of our two countries. And, we can be successful in achieving these goals if we work together; build a climate of trust and confidence; and we stay sensitive to each other's interest.\nWe deeply value our security cooperation with Sri Lanka. We should expand the maritime security cooperation between India, Sri Lanka and Maldives to include others in the Indian Ocean area.\nI often say that the course of the 21st century will be determined by the British Ocean. Shaping its direction\nWe are two countries on the Crossroads of the Indian Ocean. A peaceful, secure, stable and prosperous maritime neighbourhood.\nIn our deeply interconnected lives, it is natural to have differences Sometimes, it touches the lives of ordinary people. We have the openness in our dialogue, the strength of our human values ​​and, the goodwill in our relationship to resolve them.\nMr.Speaker,\nSri Lanka and India are a moment of great opportunity and responsibility - for realizing the dreams of our people\nThis is also a time for renewal in our relationship; for a new beginning and new vigour in our partnership\nWe have to ensure that our proximity always translates into closeness.\nWe were honored that President Sirisena chose India as his first destination last month. I am honored to be the first guest here\nThis is how should happen\nTomorrow I will go to Talaimannar to flag off the train to Madhu Road. This is part of the old India-Lanka rail link\nI recall the lines of a famous song 'Sindu Nadiyin Misai' composed by the great nationalist poet Subramanian Bharati in the early 20th century:\n'Singalatheevukkinor paalam ameippom' (We will construct a bridge to Sri Lanka)\nI have come as the hope of building this bridge - a bridge that rests on strong pillars of our shared inheritance; of shared values ​​and vision; of mutual support and solidarity; of friendly exchanges and productive cooperation; and, above all, belief in each other and our shared destiny. Thank you once again\nThank you very much"
