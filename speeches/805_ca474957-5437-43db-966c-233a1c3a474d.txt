Our partnership should be centered on progress of humanity: PM\nWe see the whole world as a family: PM\nExcellencies,\nMahatma Gandhi had once said, \"One must care about the world one will not see\". Indeed, humanity has progressed when it has been collectively risen to its obligation to the world and the responsibility to the future.\nSeventy years after the end of a tragic war and a new hope for our age, we are meeting to chart a course for our humanity and our planet. I think this is a very important summit and thank UN Secretary General for organizing it.\nJust like our vision behind the Agenda 2030 is the lofty, our goals are comprehensive. It gives priority to the problems of the past. And, it reflects our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental links that define our lives.\nWe live in an age of unprecedented prosperity, but also unspeakable deprivation around the world.\nI am happy that elimination of poverty in all forms is our goal. Addressing the needs of 1.3 billion poor people in the world is not only a question of their survival and dignity or our ethical responsibility. It is a vital necessity for ensuring peaceful, sustainable and just world.\nA great Indian thinker, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, placed the welfare of the poorest on his thoughts. This is what we also see in the 2030 Agenda. It is a happy coincidence that we are starting the celebration of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay's 100th anniversary today.\nThe goals recognize that economic growth, industrialization, infrastructure, and access to energy provide the foundations of development.\nWe welcome the prominence given to environmental goals, especially climate change and sustainable consumption. The distinct goal on Ocean ecosystem reflects the unique character of its challenges and opportunities. Equally important, it focuses on the future of the island states.\nI speak about Blue Revolution, which includes the prosperity, sustainable use of marine wealth and blue skies.\nToday, much of India's development agenda is mirrored in the sustainable Development Goals.\nSince Independence, We have pursued the dream of eliminating poverty from India We have chosen the path of removing poverty by empowering the poor We have placed priority on education and skill development.\nOur attack on गरीबी आज included expanded conventional schemes of development, but we have also launched a new era of inclusion and empowerment, turning potentials into immediate possibilities: new bank accounts for 180 million; direct transfer of benefits; funds to the unbanked; insurance within the reach of all; And, the pension for everyone's sunset years\nThe world speaks of private sector and public sector In India, we have defined a new personal sector of individual enterprise, micro enterprises and micro finance, drawing on the strength of digital and mobile applications.\nWe are focusing on the basics: housing, power, water and sanitation for all - important not just for welfare, but also human dignity These are goals with a definite date, not just a mirage of hope. Our development is intrinsically linked to empowerment of women and it begins with a massive program on education for the girl child.\nWe are making our farms more productive and better connected to markets; And, farmers are less vulnerable to the whims of nature.\nWe are reviving our manufacturing, improving our services sector, investing on an unprecedented scale in infrastructure; And, making our cities smart, sustainable and engine of progress\nWe are committed to a sustainable path to prosperity. It comes from the natural instinct of our tradition and culture. But, it is also rooted in our commitment to the future.\nWe represent a culture that calls our planet Mother Earth\nAs our ancient text say: \"Keep pure! For the Earth is our mother! And we are her children!\"\nOur national plans are ambitious and purposeful: new capacity of 175 GW of renewable energy over the next seven years; energy efficiency; a tax on coal; a huge exporestation program; reforming our transportation; and, cleaning up our cities and rivers The energy\nSustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be of great consequence to the world and our beautiful planet. It will be a world of few challenges and greater hope; And, more confidence of its success\nOur success will give us more resources As India's ancient saying goes, the wise\nToday, India is fulfilling its responsibilities as development partners in Asia and Africa and with small island states from the Pacific to the Atlantic\nNations have a national responsibility for sustainable development They also need policy space\nHowever, we are here today in the United Nations because we all believe that international partnership must be the center of our efforts, whether it is development or combating climate change.\nAnd, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the bedrock of our collective enterprise.\nWhen we speak only of climate change, there is a perception of our desire to secure the comforts of our lifestyle. When we speak of climate justice, we demonstrate our sensitivity and resolve to protect the future from the natural disasters.\nIn addressing climate change, it is important to focus on solutions that can help us reach our goals. We should be a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put the clean and renewable energy into the reach of all.\nEqually, we should look for changes in our lifestyles that will make us less dependent on our consumption.\nIt is equally critical to launch a global education program that protects our next generation.\nI hope that the developed world will fulfill its commitments for development and climate change, without any way putting both under the same head!\nI also hope that the Technology Facilitation Mechanism will turn technology and innovation into an effective instrument for global public good, not just private returns.\nAs we see now, there is no insulation from challenges And, they will rise from the shadows of conflict and privations from distant lands.\nSo, we must transform international partnerships on the strength of a solidarity with fellow human beings and also our enlightened self-interest.\nAnd, we must also reform the United Nations, including its Security Council, so that it carries greater credibility and legitimacy and our goals in achieving more representative and effective.\nThere is no reason greater than shaping a world, in which every life that enters it can be a future of security, opportunity and dignity; and, where we leave And, no cause that is more challenging\nAt 70, we are able to rise to that challenge, with our wisdom, experience, generosity, compassion, skills and technology.\nI am confident that we can\nIn the end, let me express my hope for some lines from our ancient texts:\nMay all be happy, may all be healthy, may all see welfare, may no one have any sorrow\nThank you."
