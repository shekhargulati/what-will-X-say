"Share\n\nWe bid farewell to some of our MPs in the state council. They have contributed significantly to Parliament: PM\nThe State Sabha is a distinguished house, with eminent members serving here, says PM\nThe Honorable Chairman,\nThe august house,\nI am confident that now some of our colleagues will further strengthen their role in social service after gaining this experience. Each resigning Hon'ble Honor of the House has made its own contribution, Houseand country of the members, while being the country's future bright, they are never forgetted.\nI congratulate you all for rendering a great service and I also want to convey my best wishes.\nThis house belongs to those senior members whose experience in life adds value to the House.\nThis house of elders, these senior members are capable of taking into account that what is good and what is not good for the society in the future by weighing the expectations and aspirations of the social life in a unbiased manner\nIt is a special value that carries a special significance and it is that importance which is our policy making in a very crucial role.\nWe have stalwarts like respected ParasharanJi who are living their life like a professional in life. Such kind of people are among us and now we will not be benefited from him.\nTwoplayers who are a matter of pride for India, ShrimanDileepJi and SachinJi, these two players too will not be among us in the coming days and we will not be able to benefit from them.\nPeople will always remember Professor KurienSaheb His smiling face, and it should be learned that something is to be spoken in a smiling manner, this thing has been his unique feature and because of this, his role was very important in the house in a orderly the way even in times of crisis\nIt's true that there will be very few people among us who do not have a party background or were not related to their party's ideology. There are very few people like that.Most of us are those who have some or other background and hence it'snatural for us to make efforts to establish those views here, it's extremely natural thing.\nBut this is the hope that it is not necessary that whatever happens in Lok Sabha should also happen in the State Sabha as well. And, therefore, every one has its own role because the elder of the house has its own importance.\nI believe that probably there will be a lot of people in the future, which will be the last session then I will raise this issue; Then I will come with this kind of preparation that I will retire after delivering a historical speech; that I will retire by placing these views, by making some important work of the country However, maybe, you people did not get that chance of retirement It's not the responsibility of the other side; It's the responsibility of all of us who are retiring like this.\nHad you people got the opportunity to retire by playing an important role in an important role in the life of the people. had a special sense of responsibility\nHowever, probably the person who has been deprived of that good opportunity Yesterday, it even seemed that this opportunity today However, theHonourableChairman was very hard, he tried to persuade everyone, he tried to take everyone along.Shriman Vijay Ji too pitched in\nSo finally it has become possible that all the members will be able to express their feelings. However, even then, you have lost that one last opportunity at the time of retirement for such an important decision. You got the opportunity during your tenure and you have used it too\nYou have been deprived of the opportunity to decide on the important decisions like Triple Talaq thats going to play an extremely important role in the history of India in the coming days. Those who have been re-elected, they will get the opportunity However, those who are retired today, have been deprived of the important historical decision making. And I believe that people will feel a little pain of this, if not today then it will certainly be there in the next ten, twenty or twenty five years Had Had Me Cultivated\nOnce again, I would like to get my best wishes to all those Hon'ble members, to all those honourabble members who have been retiring. I would like to urge one thing as your colleague, please do not assume that the doors of this whole house will be closed. The doors of this campus are open for you The doors of Prime Minister's office are open for you\nIn the interest of the country, whatever ideas you people come across, you are always welcome and I will be glad to hear you And wherever you might be, I would certainly try to get your ideas and your contribution.\nOnce again I thank you very much and convey my best wishes to you."
