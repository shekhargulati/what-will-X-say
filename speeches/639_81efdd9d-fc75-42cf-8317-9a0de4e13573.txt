Thank you President Ashraf Ghani, for your presence It really holds a special significance. It is a privilege to be here Excellency Rouhani, President Ghani and I have just given detailed discussions on a range of issues. The agenda for economic engagement We stand together in our purpose. To carve out new routes of peace, and prosperity is our common goal. We want to link with the world But, better connectivity It is really a new dawn for the region\nExcellencies,\nIran, Afghanistan and India are deeply aware of the richness and reality of our ancient links. Through the centuries, art and culture, ideas and knowledge, language and traditions have formed a common bond between us. Even through turmoil of history, our societies never lost touch with each other. Today, we meet in the new chapters in our engagement.\nExcellencies, The Agreement on the establishment of a Trilateral Transport and Transit Corridor signed just a while ago can alter the course of history of this region. It is a new foundation of our nation The corridor would spur uninterrupted flow of commerce throughout the region. Inflow of capital and technology could lead to new industrial infrastructure in Chahbahar. This would include gas based fertilizer plants, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and IT. The key arteries of the corridor will pass through the Chahbahar port of Iran. It's very location, on the mouth of Gulf of Oman, is of great strategic significance. Afghanistan will get an assurance, effective, and a more friendly route to the rest of the world. The arc of economic benefits from this agreement will extend beyond our three nations Its reach could extend to the Central Asian countries. When linked with the International North South Transport Corridor, it would touch South Asia at one end and Europe at another. And, studies show that as compared to the traditional sea routes, it could bring down the cost and time of the cargo trade to Europe by about 50%. Over time, we could also see it as the strong sea and land based routes that India has developed the Indian Ocean Region and South East Asia.\nExcellencies,\nThe world of 21st century offers unique opportunities.But, it also poses its own set of challenges. Today, the nature of global engagement requires a attitude this century to be more suitable, not the mindset of the century gone by. Today, the watch-words of international tiesare trust not suspicion; cooperation not dominance; inclusivity not excludence This is also the guiding philosophy and driving spirit of the Chahbahar Agreement. This will be a corridor of peace and prosperity for our people Motives of economic growth, and empowerment will drive it. It will build our security without making others vulnerable It would break the barriers among our nations and encourage new benchmarks of people-to-people contacts. And, help us to finally build what we all desire and deserve - a friendly and healthy neighbourhood.\nExcellencies,\nThe world around us is changing in fundamental ways And, the lack of broad connectivity is not only the challenge that limits our national growth. Political turmoil and undercurrents of economic stress In the Indo-Pacific, rise is a mix of political competition and economic opportunities. Global economy is still to come out of uncertainty and weakness Our present growth and future prosperity is under the influence of radical ideas and physical terror. Amidst this landscape, our three countries are blessed with the most powerful resource-our youth. Our three countries are estimated to be 60 percent of their population under 30 years of age. They are an asset in our national and regional development. We want to walk on knowledge and skills; industry and enterprise And, do not fall victim to the guns and violence. I am confident that economic benefits of the Chahbahar agreement will expand trade, attract investment, build infrastructure, develop industry and create jobs for our youth. The Agreement will strengthen our ability to stand in mutual support against those whose only motto is to maim and kill the innocents. Its success\nExcellencies, It is my strong belief that trade and transit routes will be a starting point of our tour. In my vision, the full spectrum of connectivity agenda between Iran, Afghanistan and India should span: • from culture to commerce;\n• from traditions to technology;\n• from services to strategy; and\n• from people to politics\nIn a way, it is a pledge to:\n• Realize the imperative of better connectivity;\n• Establish peace and create stability;\n• Build economic prosperity and engineer new trade ties;\n• Curb radicalism and remove shadows of terror; and\n• Break barriers and spreading sweetness of familiarity among our people\nHistory will look back at this effort with nothing but approval and admiration.\nI Excellencies Rouhani and Ghani for their leadership\nThank you all.
