It is celebrated as the world of a victory of virtue, hope, knowledge and prosperity. The Diwali lights are still on in Singapore.\nThe Fintech Festival is also a celebration of faith.\nBelief in the spirit of innovation and the power of imagination.\nBelief in the energy\nBelief in making the world a better place\nAnd, it is no surprise that in the third year, this festival is already the world's biggest.\nSingapore has been a global hub for finance and, it is currently taking a leap in the digital future of finance.\nIt was here, in June this year, India's World class Unified Payment Interface or UPI using that I launched India's RuPay card and the first international remittance mobile app.\nToday, I will have the honor to launch a global platform to connect fintech companies and financial institutions, beginning with ASEAN and Indian banks and fintech companies.\nIndia and Singapore are also working to connect Indian and Asian small and medium enterprises, anchored on an Indian platform, and expand it globally.\nFriends,\nI have heard about an advisor\n● To increase your Venture Capital or VC funding by 10 percent, tell the investors you run a \"platform\", not a regular business.\n● If you want to increase your VC funding by 20 percent, tell the investors that you are operating in the \"fintech space\"\n● But, if you really want investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using \"blockchain\"\nIt tells you the excitement and war of emerging technologies.\nIndeed, history has shown that the new technology and connectivity\nFriends,\nWe are in an age of technology\nFrom desktop to cloud, from internet to social media, from IT Services to Internet of Things, we have come here as a short time. There is daily disruption in businesses.\nThe Character\nTechnology is defining competitiveness and power in the new world.\nAnd, it is becoming unlimited opportunities to transform lives\nI had said at the United Nations in 2014 that we have to believe that development and empowerment can spread the same speed at which Facebook, Twitter or mobile phones have spread.\nAcross the world, that vision is rapidly changing in reality.\nIn India, it has transformed governance and delivery of public services. It has unleashed innovation, hope and opportunities. It has empowered the weak and brought in mainstream those who are on the margins .It has made economic access more democratic.\nMy government came to office in 2014 with a mission of inclusive development that would touch the lives of every citizen - the weakest in the remotest village.\nThat mission needed a solid foundation of financial inclusion for all - a work that was not easy in a country of India's size.\nYet, we wanted to achieve this in months, not years that conventional wisdom suggested.\nWith the power of fintech and the reach of digital connectivity, we have launched a revolution of unprecedented speed and scale.\nTo start with financial inclusion is 1.3 billion Indians We have generated more than 1.2 billion biometric identities - called Aadhaar or foundation - in just a few years.\nWith our Jan Dhan Yojana, we aimed to give a bank account to every Indian. In three years, we have opened 330 million new bank accounts. These are 330 million sources of identity, dignity and opportunities.\nLess than 50 percent of Indians had bank accounts in 2014; Now, it is almost universal\nSo today, more than one billion biometric identities, more than one billion bank accounts and more than one billion cell phones give India by far the biggest public infrastructure in the world.\nMore than Rupees 3.6 lakh crore, or 50 billion dollars of benefits from government directly\nNo longer a poor citizen in a remote village travel long distances or pay off middle-men to get her rights\nNo longer can fake and duplicate accounts bleed government finance We have saved over Rupees 80,000 crore, or 12 billion dollars in prevented leakages.\nNow, millions who lived on the edge of uncertainty received insurance in their accounts; And, have access to the security of pension\nA student can get her scholarship directly in her account. No longer will be lost in end-less paper chase.\nBanking has come to doorsteps even in remote villages through 400,000 micro ATMs based on Aadhaar.\nAnd now, this digital infrastructure has helped launch the world's largest healthcare scheme this year. Ayushman will provide affordable health insurance to 500 million Indians\nIt has also helped us extend 145 million loans for small enterprises through Mudra scheme. In four years, they amount to Rupees 6.5 lakh crore, or 90 billion dollars. Nearly 75 percent of these loans have gone to women\nJust a few weeks ago, we launched the India Post Payments Bank. Over 150 thousand post offices across and 300,000 postal service employees are using technology for home banking.\nOf course financial inclusion also needs digital connectivity\nMore than 120,000 village councils in India have already been connected by around 300,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables.\nOver 300,000 Common Service Centers have brought digital access to villages. They give our farmers better access to land records, credit, insurance, market and the best price. They deliver health services and hygiene products to women.\nNone of the big changes brought about by fintech - the digitization of payments and transactions in India\nIndia is a nation of different situations and challenges.Our solutions must be be varied.Our digitization is a success, as our payment products are all in the cater.\nFor those with mobile and internet, the BHIM-UPI is the world's most sophisticated, easyand seamless platform for payments between accounts, using a virtual payment address.\nFor those who have a mobile, but no internet, there is US.S.S.D. system in 12 languages\nAnd, for those who have neither mobile nor internet, there is Aadhar Enabled Payment System, which uses biometrics. And, it has already registered one billion transactions and grown six-fold in two years.\nRuPay is bringing the cards into the reach of all.Over 250 million of these are with those who did not have a bank account 4 years ago.\nFrom cards to QRs and wallets, digital transactions in India are growing rapidly. Today, 128 banks in India are connected to UPI\nTransactions on UPI grew 1500 times in the last 24 months. Every month, the value of transaction is growing by over 30 percent.\nBut, more than the pace, I am inspired by the opportunities, efficiency, transparency and convenience that digital payment is generating.\nA shopkeeper can go online to reduce his inventory and speed up collections.\nFor a fruit grower, a farmer or a rural artisan, the markets are direct and closer, earnings are high, and payments are faster.\nA worker collects wages or remits money home\nEvery digital payment saves time It adds to a huge national savings It is growing productivity of individuals and our economy.\nIt also helps improve\nEven more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities.\nData Analytics and Artificial Intelligence are helping people in the United States.\nFinancial inclusion also extends to micro, small and medium enterprises.\nThey are all on the nation-wide Goods and Services Tax digital network, launched just over a year ago.\nBanks are reaching credit Alternative loaning platforms are offering innovative financing models. They are no longer looking at informal markets for credit at high interest rates.\nAnd, just this month, we committed to approve loans up to Rupees 1 crore, or one 150,000 dollars for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises within 59 minutes - without even visiting a bank. This is driven by an algorithm that uses GST returns, Income Tax returns and bank statements to make credit decisions. In just a few days, 150,000 such enterprises have come\nThis is the power of finitech to drive enterprise, employment and prosperity.\nDigital technology is introducing transparency and elimination corruption through innovations such as Government e-Marketor GEM It is an integrated platform for purchases by government agencies.\nIt provides everything - search and comparison, tender, online ordering, contract generation and payment.\nIt already has 600,000 products. Early 30,000 buyer organization and more than 150,000 sellers and service providers are registered on the platform.\nFriends\nThere is an explosion of finitech innovation and enterprise in India. It has turned India into a leading fintech and startup nation in the world. The future of fintech and industry is 4.0 in emerging in India.\nOur youth is developing apps that are making the dream of paperless, cashless, presence-less, and yet safe and secure, transactions possible for all. That is the wonder of India Stack-simply the biggest set of application programming in the world.\nThey are using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Machine Learning to create solutions for banks, regulators and consumers.\nAnd, they are also embracing our nation's social missions - from health and education to micro credit and insurance.\nThis enormous talent pool in India benefits from the ecosystem created by initiatives such as Digital India and Startup India, and by supportive policies, incentives and funding programs.\nIt also helps that India has the biggest data consumption in the world and the cheapest rates for data.And one of the top nations in fintech adoption. So, I say this to all the fintech companies and startups - India is your best destination\nThe economies of scale achieved in India by the LED bulb industry. Similarly, India's vast market can enable fintech products to achieve scale, reduce risks, and go global\nFriends\nIn short, the Indian story shows six great benefits of fintech: Access, inclusion; connectivity; ease of living; opportunity; and, accountability\nAcross the world, from the Indo-Pacific to Africa to Latin America, we see inspirational stories of extraordinary innovation changing ordinary lives.\nBut, there is much to be done\nOur focus should be development of all, through, that is, development of the most marginalised.\nWe should bring the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the financial financial market.\nWe must extend the security of insurance and the pension to more than a billion workers in the informal sectors worldwide, who still have it.\nWe can use fintech to ensure that no dream remains unfulfilled, and no enterprise is still born, because of lack of access to finance\nWe must make banks and financial institutions more suspect in managing risks, fighting frauds and dealing with disruption of traditional models.\nWe have used technology to improve compliance, regulation and supervision, so that innovation flourishes and risks are included.\nWe should use fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\nThe emerging world of finance will succeed in our inter-connected world when our data and systems are trusted and secure.\nWe have made our global wired system safe from cyber threats.\nWe should also ensure that the pace and the push of Fintech work to the people, not to their disadvantage; that technology in finance makes the improvement\nWe also need to improve awareness of the masses and educate them about the opportunities which are inclusive policies and use of technology open up for them.\nFor this, fintech will need to do only a mechanism but a movement.\nAnd, we have to address the inevitable questions of data ownership and flow, privacy and consent; private and public good; law and ethics\nFinally, we should be able to create skills for the future. And, be prepared for the long term.\nFriends\nEvery era is defined by its opportunities and challenges. Every generation has its responsibility to shape future.\nThis generation will shape the palm of every hand in the world.\nAt no time in history\nto make opportunities and prosperity a reality, for billions.\nto make the world more humane and equal -between rich and poor, between cities and villages, between hopes and achievements\nJust as India will learn from others, we will share our experience and expertise with the world.\nBecause, what drives India too holds hope for others And, what is our dream for India is\nThis is a common tour for all.\nLike this festival of light that calls us to spread light over darkness, hope and happiness over despair, this festival calls for mankind to a better future for pursuing the coming together.\nThank you.\n\nIt is a great honor to be the first Head of Government to deliver the keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival: PM pic.twitter.com/48PSYr7m46\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nThe Fintech Festival is also a celebration of faith: PM pic.twitter.com/x7azo0chtb\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nWe are an age of an historical transition brought about by technology: PM pic.twitter.com/7XyV8R0xId\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nMy government came to office in 2014 with a mission of inclusive development that would change the lives of every citizen, even the weakest in the remotest village: PM pic.twitter.com/tBgE2oIOpo\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nFinancial inclusion has become a reality for 1.3 billion Indians: PM pic.twitter.com/FMqRSdqZOs\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nIndia is a nation of diverse circumstances and challenges\nOur solutions should also be varied\nOur digitization is a success as our payment products cater to everyone: PM pic.twitter.com/5bYsSrVIPV\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nRapidly growing Digital Transactions in India powered by Rupay \u0026 BHIM: PM pic.twitter.com/zK8f3rJuwm\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nThe endless potential \u0026 possibilities of Digital Transactions: PM pic.twitter.com/uQypRKXPfs\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nDigital technology is also introducing transparency and elimination corruption through innovation such as the @GeM_India: PM pic.twitter.com/pZTyWC1uPJ\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nThere is an explosion of fintech innovation and enterprise in India: PM pic.twitter.com/wvbO2xP4Ci\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\ni say this to all the fintech companies and startups - India is your best destination: PM pic.twitter.com/BXOpt7T32v\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nThe Indian story shows six great benefits of fintech: PM pic.twitter.com/i33NgALjjZ\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nWe see inspiring stories of extraordinary innovations.\nBut, there is much to be done\nOur focus should be on Sarvodaya through interdisciplinary: PM pic.twitter.com/RDlpjMcA57\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nFintech could be used to make the world a better place: PM pic.twitter.com/fzNUEaW3XO\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 14, 2018\nAt no time in history\nTo make opportunities and prosperity a reality in a lifetime for billions.\nTo make the world more humane and equal -\nbetween rich and poor,"
