"\nPM's statement\nFollowing is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement before his visit to Davos.\n\"I look forward to my first visit to the World Economic Forum at Davos, at the invitation of India's good friend and founder of the WEF, Prof Klaus Schwab. The theme of the Forum, \"Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World\" is both thoughtful and apt.\nThe current and emerging challenges to the contemporary international system and global governance architecture deserve serious attention of leaders, governments, policy makers, corporates and civil society around the world.\nIn recent years, India's engagement with the outside world has become truly and effective multi-dimensional covering the political, economic, people to people, security and other spheres.\nAt Davos, I look forward to sharing my vision for India's future engagement with the international community.\nApart from the events for the World Economic Forum, I look forward to my separate bilateral meetings with the President of the Swiss Confederation H. E. Alain_Berset and Prime Minister of Sweden H. E. Mr. Stefan Lofven\nI am confident that these bilateral meetings will be fruitful and give a boost to our countries and further strengthen economic engagement \".\nI look forward to my first visit to the World Economic Forum at Davos, at the invitation of India's good friend and founder of the WEF, Prof Klaus Schwab.
