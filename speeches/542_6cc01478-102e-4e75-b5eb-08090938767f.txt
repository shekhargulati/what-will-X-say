Sat Sri Akal\nIt is an honor to speak on the inaugural session of the 6th Ministerial Conference of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process on Afghanistan.\nAnd, it is a special pleasure to jointly inaugurate this conference with our friend and partner, President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan.\nI am thanking my greatness for accepting my invitation and for gracing this conference. It is also a great privilege for me to welcome all of you in Amritsar, a city blessed with simplicity, beauty and spiritualuality, and abode to the golden temple, the holiest shrines of Sikhs.\nIt is a place made sacred by Sikh Gurus who meditated here. It embodies peace and humanism, and is open to all people and religions. Its streets and parks tell stories of great valour and immense sacrifice.\nIt is a city whose character has been shaped by proud patriotism and generous philanthropy of its residents. And, their spirit of enterprise, creativity and hard work. Amritsar also happens to be a native and steadfast connection of warmth and affection with Afghanistan.\nAmong the earliest disciples of the first Guru of Sikhs, Baba Guru Nanak Dev ji, were Afghans he had preached to in Kabul in the 15th century.\nEven today, the shrine of an Afghan-origin sufi saint called Baba Hazrat Sheikh in Punjab is revered by all faiths, including visitors from Afghanistan.\nThe flow of trade, people and ideas through our region is often intersected in Amritsar on one of Asia's oldest and longest surface arteries, the Grand Trunk Road. Amritsar reinforces the value of restoring connectivity which is so critical for overall growth, stability and economic prosperity of Afghanistan.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nSince the turn of this century, the international community has been extensively engaged in Afghanistan.\nMajor powers, regional countries and related countries have been cooperated through multiple programs, political, social, economic, and developmental support.\nOur gathering today re-affirms the commitment of the international community to be durable peace and lasting political stability in Afghanistan. Our words and actions remain focused on a critical unfinished mission of our time.\nAnd, that is to help Afghanistan:\nBuild and strengthen its social, political and institutional fabric;\nSecure its territory and citizens from external threats,\nSpur its economic and development activity,\nand stitch a positive and prosperous future for its people\nIndeed, this is also the intent of this conference, aptly captured in its theme, \"Addressing challenges; Achieving prosperity\".\nWe have no doubt about the scale of the challenge. But, we are equally determined to succeed\nThe results of our collective efforts have thus far been hard-won, but mixed. There have been important successes. Much more remains to be done\nThe need of the hour We must protect and build on the gains of the last fifteen years and the march ahead.\nBecause, that is not just the future of Afghanistan that has invested in a vision of development, democracy, and pluralism. But, the peace and stability of the whole region, and beyond\nLet us also reflect on the urgency on what more must be done and what we will avoid in Afghanistan so that its citizens will self-sustain peace and economic growth. The answers are all there The question is of resolve and action And, of putting Afghanistan and its people first.\nFor this, First, an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process is key. It is the only guarantor of durability of solutions. Second, we must demonstrate strong collective will defeat networks that cause bloodshed and spread fear.\nTerrorism and externally induced instability pose the gravest threat to Afghanistan's peace, stability and prosperity. And, the growing arc of terrorist violence endangers our whole region As such, support for voices of peace in Afghanistan alone\nIt must be backed by resolute action Not just against forces of terrorism, but also those who support, shelter, train and finance them.\nSilence and inaction against terrorism in Afghanistan and our region will only embolden terrorists and their masters Third, our bilateral and regional commitments of material assistance for Afghanistan's development and humanitarian needs must continue and increase.\nOur cooperative endeavors in Afghanistan should contribute to its infrastructure and institutional capacity, and self-propelling engines of growth.\nFourth, we should all build strong positive connectivity between Afghanistan and other countries of the region.\nAfghanistan should be at the center of our connectivity networks, not peripheral to them. On our part, we see Afghanistan as the hub for strengthening links of connectivity between South Asia and Central Asia.\nWe can not deny that the more connected Afghanistan is with the regional arteries of trade, capital and markets, the more assured its economic growth and progress. President Ghani and I have been converged on the priority of strengthening trade and transport links with other partners in the region.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nOn India's part, our commitment to our brave Afghan brothers and sisters is absolute and unwavering. The welfare of Afghanistan and its people are close to our hearts and minds.\nThe successful record of our partnership in projects, big and small, in Afghanistan speaks for itself. The principal determination of our cooperation has always been its people centric nature.\nOur joint efforts:\neducate Afghanistan's young and nurture their skills;\nprovide healthcare and improvement;\nbuild infrastructure and institutions; and\nallow traders and small businesses in Afghanistan to connect with immense commercial and economic opportunities in India\nAnd, the reach of all corners of Afghanistan Herat's India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, also called the Salma Dam, that was launched some months ago\nThe Parliament Building in Kabul represents our strong commitment to Afghanistan's democratic future. Zeranj-Deleram highway and India-Afghanistan-Iran-cooperation on Chahbahar will enable Afghanistan to link its economy with strong economic growth in South Asia and beyond.\nWe also plan to connect with Afghanistan\nPresident Ghani and I have discussed about our countries for development. We are making progress in developing plans for the use of the additional 1 billion US Dollar by India for capacity and capacity building in Afghanistan.\nIt will extend areas like water management, health, infrastructure, energy and skill development. As India implements its additional commitments, we are open to work with other like-minded partners for the development of Afghanistan.\nWe are also happy to note the international commitments at the Brussels Conference in October and NATO's Warsaw Summit in July this year. We will continue efforts to scale up our ambition and dedication to help Afghanistan\nIn this, we will learn more about our experiences.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen\nLet us remember that every passing day we help Afghanistan to achieves successful political, security and economic transitions, we are also helping ourselves create a more peaceful region and world.\nI hope that your deliberations will produce constructive and forward looking pathways for action that:\npromote cooperation in place of conflict,\ndevelopment in place, and\nsecurity in place of terrorism\nLet us re-dedicate ourselves to making peace A place where reason and peace succeeds; progress and prosperity prevails and democracy and plurality wins.\nThank you.\nIt is a special pleasure to jointly inaugurate this conference with our friend and partner, President @ashrafghani of Afghanistan: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nSince the turn of this century, the international community has extensively engaged in Afghanistan: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nOur gathering today re-affirms commitment of the international community to durable peace and lasting political stability in Afghanistan: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nWe must protect and build on the last fifteen years and March ahead: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nWe will demonstrate strong collective will to defeat terror network that cause bloodshed and spread fear: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nSilence and inaction against terrorism in Afghanistan and our region will only embolden terrorists and their masters: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nWe want to build strong positive connectivity between Afghanistan and other countries of the region: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nOn India's part, our commitment to our brave Afghan brothers and sisters is absolute and unwavering: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\nAs India implements its additional commitments, we are open to work with other like-minded partners for the development of Afghanistan: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 4, 2016\n'Heart of Asia' Conference in Amritsar reaffirms the commitment of the international community towards durable peace \u0026 stability in Afghanistan. pic.twitter.com/1DSYAk1h8v\n- Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 4, 2016\nWe want to help Afghanistan's economic activity, secure itself from external threats, and a stable, prosperous future for its people.\n- Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 4, 2016\nPM starts address at #HeartofAsia inauguration, thanks President @ashrafghani for accepting invitation and for gracing the conference pic.twitter.com/6YuSPZlMdB\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: It is also a great privilege for me to welcome all of you in Amritsar, a city blessed w / simplicity, beauty \u0026 spiritualuality pic.twitter.com/Uf0XESR9d7\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: Amritsar nurtures a old and steadfast connection of warmth and affection with Afghanistan pic.twitter.com/1ZpSiF7loj\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: Our gathering today re-affirms the commitment of the int'l community to durable peace \u0026 lasting stability in Afghanistan\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: Our words and actions remain focused on a critical unfinished mission of our time pic.twitter.com/ETap8XlWac\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: We must protect and build on the gains of the last fifteen years and next to March. pic.twitter.com/oy1WDHMo8O\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM identifies four key issues in support Afghanistan, start w / an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned \u0026 Afghan-controlled process pic.twitter.com/rDaHaU7M76\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: Second, we must demonstrate strong collective will defeat networks that cause bloodshed and spread fear. pic.twitter.com/bHDlYdnle6\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM: Third, our bilateral and regional commitments of material assistance for ongoing and increase. pic.twitter.com/0Iky3htcG7\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM highlights the issue of connectivity: We see Afgh as the hub for strengthening links of connectivity btw South Asia \u0026 Central Asia\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM on the record of India's partnership to projects: Our commitment to our brave Afghan brothers and sisters is absolute and unwavering pic.twitter.com/d9z7rr8Rhs\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM speaks of numerous projects under the partner'p, from the Friendship Dam to Parliament building, capacity building, health and more pic.twitter.com/dz6eCYBgbZ\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: We also plan to connect with Afghanistan via India a air transport corridor\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM: I hope that your deliberate will generate pathways of action that promote coop'n in place of conflict and security in place of terrorism pic.twitter.com/bJfbHAiHbk\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) December 4, 2016\nPM @narendramodi concludes: Let us re-dedicate ourselves to making Afghanistan a Geography of Peace #HeartofAsia pic.twitter.com/nJYXMFdIJO"
