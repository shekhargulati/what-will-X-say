"Share\n\nOur aim is to generate 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, of which 100 GW would be from solar power: PM Modi\nPM Modi calls for harnessing solar energy, points towards developing, latest technology and innovation in the domain\nPM Modi launches out of 10 points\nPM Modi calls for developing low cost solar energy and increasing scope of solar in energy mix\nPM Modi lays stress on promoting solar energy based innovations\nHis Excellency President Macron, His Excellencies President and Prime Ministers, Distinguish Guests,\nLadies and Gentlemen, Greetings, I heartily welcome all of you in the founding conference of International Solar Alliance\nThe seed for this historic day was today sown during the 21st Conference of Parties in November 2015 in Paris. Today, the green shoots of that seed have sprouted.\nFrance has played an invaluable role in the new possibilities of this young sapling. This young sapling of International Solar Alliance has not been planted without the collective effort and commitment of all. And so I'm extremely grateful to France and to all of you Sixty one of the 121potential countries have joined the alliance Thirty two of them have also been ratified the Framework Agreement. However, in this alliance, in addition to all of uspartner countries; The SunGod is our biggest ally who has been providing light to our environment.\nFriends,\nThe Sun has been giving light and life to the world and millions of years ago, even before the birth of life on this earth. Every civilization from Japan to Peru, be it Greece or Rome, Egypt or the Inca and ancient the Maya civilization, all the given importance and respect to the Sun.\nHowever, the central place assigned to the Sun in the Indian philosophy\nIn India, theSun was the soul of the world in Vedas thousand of years ago. In India, the Sun has been considered as the source of the whole life. Today, when we have been trying to find the ways to tackle the challenge of climate change then we have to have the broad approach and balance of the ancient philosophy.\nFriends,\nMahatma Gandhi: 'The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing most of the world's problems',' Our Green future depends onthe fact, that's what we do together.\nToday, the presence of the leaders from all over the world is a reflection of the solar energy that provides a sustainable way of life.\nFriends,\nWe have started the world's largest renewable energy expansion program in India. We will produce 175 gig wattsof electricity from renewable sources and 100 gigawatts of electricity production of that will be solar energy.\nWe have already achieved the target of 20 gigawatts of installed power. In India, more capacity is being added through renewable sources\nThe objective of the Atal Jyoti Scheme in India is to install solar energy based street lights in those areas where there is a shortage of electricity.Solar Study Lamp Scheme has seven million school going children in the light.\nThe results can be even better if we link the solar energy with other technologies. For example, the distribution of 28 crore LED bulbs by the government has not only saved more than $ 2 billion in the last three years but it also saved 4 gig wattsof electricity. It's not just that, generation of carbon dioxide also reduced by 30 million tones.\nFriends,\nWe seek a solar revolution only in India You have seen the songs, speeches and videos of the Solar Mamas trained in India Now you are very well aware of these Solar Mamas Their story is inspiring in itself\nWe are happy that in addition to making contributions in the ISA Corpus Fund an amount of $ 62 million has been given for the establishment of ISA Secretariat. I'm happy to announce that every year we will provide 500 training slots to ISA members in the field of solar energy.\nWe have either completed 13 solar projects worth $ 143 million dollars in the whole world or they are implemented in the process of being implemented. India is going to provide an assistance of $ 1.4 billion to 27 more projects in 15 other developing countries\nWe have set up a project preparation facility which will provide consultancy support for designing bankable projects.\nToday, I'm also happy to announce that India will also start a solar technology mission in the field of solar technology. This mission will have an international focus and it will provide leadership in the R \u0026 D efforts in the field of solar technology by putting together all our governmental, technical and educational institutions.\nFriends,\nThe development and use of solar energy which is available in abundance like air will definitely reduce the carbon footprint on the earth in addition to making us prosperous.\nFriends,\nWe have to keep some things in mind. And these are: On the one hand there are many countries where the sun shines throughout the year but the lack of resources and technology acts as a impediment, the use of solar energy in a hurdle as a function.\nOn the other hand there are such islands and countries which face the direct impact of climate change. Thirdly, not just the light but solar energy can also be useful in many other areas like transport, clean cooking, in agriculture, solar pumps and health care.\nAvailability and development of technology, financial resources, reduction in the cost, development of storage technology, mass manufacturing and a whole eco-system for innovation is very important.\nFriends,\nWe all have There is ten action points in my mind that I would like to share today. First of all, we will have to be easily and conveniently available to all.\nWe will have to increase the proportion of our energy mix. We will have to promote the innovation\nWe will have to provide a subsidized funding and less risky finance for solar projects. We will have developed such regulatory aspects and standards that can provide a new momentum to the development and adoption of solar solutions. Development of consultancy support for bankable solar projects\nMore inclusiveness and partnership We should create a comprehensive network of centers of excellence that can take into account the local factors and circumstances We should look at solar energy policy in the totality of development so that it can make the maximum contribution in achieving the SDGs. We should make the ISA Secretariat strong and professional\nFriends,\nI am confident that we will be able to move forward on all these actionable points through the ISA.\nFriends,\nThis is the journey today Our alliance will further illuminate our lives. It can make meaningful this saying: 'Let us make the Sun brighter' The soul of Indian philosophy has always been Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam, it means: 'The whole world is a family'\nI am confident that if we seek the betterment of the whole world, then we will be able to forge unity and cohesion in our efforts and objectives like a family.\nFriends,\nThis is the same path through which we can rehearse the prayer of ancient sages - Tamso MaJyotirgamay - it means 'let's move towards light from darkness'.\nThank you very much"
