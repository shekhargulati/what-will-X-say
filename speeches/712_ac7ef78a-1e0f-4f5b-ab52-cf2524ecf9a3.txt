"Share\n\nAsia is at the crossroads of a very special moment in the history of mankind: PM\nAll Asian civilizations had had a common value system which could cause conflict between human beings and humans and nature: PM\nConflict avoidance based on harmonizing the diversity of humans is inherent in Asian democracy as its basic value: PM Narendra Modi\nPrime Minister Modi says our democratic approach is on the consensus\nOur idea of ​​democracy is established on values ​​which is the only human but also of nature: PM Narendra Modi\nFollowing is the transcript of video message of Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi for the Tokyo meet on January 19, 2016:\nI am happy that the Tokyo Foundation is hosting a conclave on the theme of \"Asian Values ​​and Democracy\" on January 19 as the last year of Vivekananda International Foundation in Delhi by the follow-up of the conclave.\nThe theme of the two-day conference held in Delhi in September 2015 was \"Conflict Avoidance and Environmental Consciousness\" from the Hindu Buddhist civilizational perspective.\nIt is universally accepted that this century belongs to Asia Asia is the crossroads of humanity This is a continent bustling with energy, enthusiasm and exuberance, driven by the dynamism of a youthful population that is constantly innovating.\nAll Asian civilizations, Indic, Shinto, or Dao, had had a common value system which could cause conflicts between humans and the humans and nature-- the conflict between states being different. That common value system recognizes, accepts and even celebrates diversity among humans This is what leads to conflict avoidance Conflicts are based on harmonizing the diversity of humans inherent in Asian democracy as its basic value.\nOur idea of ​​democracy is not just a game of numbers mediated by the laws of majority and minority as it happens in numerical democracies. Our democratic approach is established on consensus It does not rest on the idea of ​​rights but also include duties. The Indian constitution provides for the fundamental duties of individuals towards one and the creation which sustains us all.\nOur idea of ​​democracy is established on values ​​which is the place of not only humans but also of nature - animals and plants - which include the principles of the environment.\nThe inclusion of nature and environment makes our life and approach less anthropocentric and more eco-centric.\nGreat Indian thinkers like Maharishi Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore have envisioned Asian unity in this higher sense of the term.\nI am sure that with its theme of Asian Values ​​and Democracy, the Tokyo Conclave will enable India and Japan to expand articulate and include the concept of conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness as integral to our big democratic framework.\nWith this I wish the Tokyo Conclave all success I send my heartiest congratulations to the Tokyo Foundation and the Japanese government for having organized this meeting.\nThank you."
