Your visit gives us an opportunity to reciprocate the warmth and good-will\nFriends,\nThe people of India and Turkey have nurtured deep and historical links. Ties of culture and language\nWhile Rumi found his home in Turkey, his legacy continues to enrich the Sufi traditions of India as well.\nFriends, In our comprehnsive discussions today, President Erdogan and I took stock of full range of our relations, specially our political, economic and cultural engagement. We also share perspectives on our areas\nFriends,\nIndia and Turkey are two large economies. President and I are clear that the strength of our economies presents an enormous opportunity to expand and deepen commercial linkages between our countries. I also feel that there is a strategic and long-term manner. Our bilateral trade turnover of around 6 billion dollars does not mean full justice to our economies. Clearly, the business and industry on both sides can do more\nI am happy that a high level business delegation is accompanying President Erdogan both of us addressed them, and the captains of Indian industry this morning.\nI am sure Turkish businesses would be quick to tap the different and unique opportunities in rapidly growing India. I also believe that India's infrastructure needs, and I listed some of them on this morning at the Business Summit, and our vision of developing the Developers' Smart Cities match well with the Turkish capacities.\nWe would like to encourage strong partnerships with Turkish companies with our flagship programs and projects, either on their own or in collaboration with the Indian companies.\nI have no doubt that the agreement signed today and the matter of our conversation will be strengthened.\nFriends,\nWe live in times where our societies face new threats and challenges every day. The context and contours of some of the current and emerging security challenges globally is our common concern\nIn particular, the constant evolving threat from terrorism is our shared concern. I held a wide conversation We agree that no intent or goal no reason or rationale can validate terrorism.\nThe nations of the world, therefore, need to work as an Internet citizen and their financing and put a stop to cross border movement of terrorists. They also need to stand and act against those that conceive and create, support and sustain, shelter and spread the instruments and ideologies of violence.\nPresident and I agree to work together to strengthen our cooperation, both effectively and effectively.\nFriends,\nWe also discussed the need for comprehendive UN reforms including the Security Council. Both of us recognize the need for the UN Security Council to reflect the world's first century and not the century gone by.\nExcellency,\nLet me welcome you once again in India I thank you for very productive discussions Our decisions today will certainly drive the India-Turkey partnership to a higher level. I wish you a fruitful stay in India\nThank You\nThank you very much\nPM @narendramodi starts press statement, welcomes President @RT_Erdogan to India, recalls his visit to Turkey for the G-20 Summit in Nov '15 pic.twitter.com/FHI6uuOf4i\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM: People of India \u0026 Turkey have nurtured deep \u0026 historical links; ties of culture \u0026 language connect our societies since the millennia\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM: President and I are clear that the strengths of our economies present an enormous opportunity to expand and deepen our commercial linkages\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: We need to approach the whole landscape of business opportunities in a strategic and long-term manner.\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM: Encourage strangers partner'p of Turkish cos with our flagship progms \u0026 tap in varied \u0026 unique opp'ties in in rapidly grow'g India\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM: Nations of the world need to wrink as a distrupt terrorist ntwrks \u0026 their financing, and put a stop to cross border move't of terrorists\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: They also need to stand and act against those who make, support, shelter and spread terrorism\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM: President \u0026 I decided to work together to strengthen cooperation, both the bilaterally \u0026 multilaterally, to effectively counter this drug.\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) May 1, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: Both of us recognize the need for the UNSC to reflect the world of the 21st century and not of the century gone by."
