It is a great way to get involved in the presence of an enlightened leader like Chancellor Merkel. In fact, I do not miss any chance of meeting her I would like to mention about my interactions during my trip to Hannover Fair in April 2015. This was followed by Chancellor Merkel's visit to India in October 2015. Together, we had several rounds of discussion with German and Indian CEOs. Today again, I can see lot of energy and enthusiasm in this hall. I can also see a number of Indian CEOs present here.\nFriends!\nGermany is among the most important partners in both worldly and in the global context. I am very happy to see the participation of German companies in India's growth story. It is equally heartening to see that Indian companies have also made their presence felt in Germany. Germany ranks 7th among overseas investors in India Major sectors attracting FDI inflows from Germany are engineering, chemicals and services. About 600 Indo-German joint ventures are currently operating in India. They provide employment to around two hundred thousand people However, there is a tremendous potential in India-Germany economic collaboration. Our Economic Partnership is still below its full potential To enhance this, we, in India, are ready to open arms to welcome German companies With a view to help the German companies, we have put in place a Fast Track Mechanism. A number of issues have already been resolved through this mechanism. We are doing it sincerely because we value German participation a lot\nFriends!\nWe are on the path of making India a global manufacturing hub. Already a good eco-system exists in India for manufacturing. India already offers:\nA globally cost competitive manufacturing eco-system;\nA vast pool of skilled professionals with knowledge and energy;\nWorld class engineering education base and strong R \u0026 D facilities;\nRise in GDP and purchasing power creating further growth in the domestic market;\nOne of the most liberal FDI policy regimes in the world;\nGovernment's focus\nDue to these strengths, as said by UNIDO, India is already the 6th largest manufacturing nation in the world. To make it better, we are working hard on different enablers.\nThrough our 'Make in India' initiative, we are committed to transform India as a major player in the global value chain. Prime motive is the creation of jobs and narrowing the gap between the rich and lower sections of society. Make in India has already created a strong influence\nGermany is contributing in a big way in the success of Make in India Particularly, India's participation as Partner country in the Hannover Fair has given a big boost to Indo-German partnership. During the Hannover Messe, specific areas for collaboration were mutually identified. This included manufacturing, skill development, railways, cleaning of rivers, renewable energy, education, science and technology. In addition, we are also implementing a strategic market entry support program, since September 2015. It is called MIIM (Make in India Mittelstand). This is the main reason to help German companies in entering the Indian market.\nThe MIIM program has been offering a wide range of business support services. The initiative is growing in German companies in India\nThe results are:\n83 companies have expressed interest in join the program;\n73 companies have registered as official members;\n47 are the advanced stage of investment implementation. India and Germany are the Indo-German Managers Training Program. This is for advanced training of business executives, especially from Indian SMEs. The program has resulted in:\nincreased investments, creation of new joint ventures and increased B2B contacts between the two countries\nOver 500 Indian managers have benefited from this program.\nIn addition, there is a good weather already existing. Some examples are:\nBosch, Siemens, BASF and SAP have started the specific R \u0026 D operations exclusively in India\nMercedes Benz India inaugurated its second manufacturing facility in Chakan in July 2015. This will double the plant capacity to 20,000 units per year.\nFor our efforts, we have also received good global recognition. I would like to mention some of them.\nIndia remains a bright spot in the subdued economic landscape across the world;\nIndia has emerged as the fastest growing major economy with the last three years with GDP growth rate of over 7%;\nWe have moved up 32 places in the last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum- This is the highest for any country;\nIndia also moved up 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank;\nWe have also moved up to 16 places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in 2016.\nWe are 3rd among the top 10 FDI destinations by UNCTAD;\nThese are just a few examples. Our emphasis is on reducing Govevrnment and enhancing Governance. I would give some examples:\nWe are moving towards becoming a Digital Economy;\nGST is the most Historic reforms India has ever done- and it is going to be implemented from next month;\nIn the last two years, we have moved on a low tax regime, both on personal as well as corporate side;\nWe have lowered the corporate tax to 30% to 25% specially for new investments and small ventures;\nNew laws and institutions for Bankruptcy and Insolvency as well as IPR and Arbitration are now in place;\nMore than seven thousand reforms have been implemented.\n36 white industries have been taken out from the requirement of environmental clearance;\nSimilarly, more than 50 items had taken out of the defence list;\nValidity period of industrial licenses has been increased upto fifteen years;\nCustom clearance has been made 24X7 at 19 ports and 17 air cargo complexes;\nIncorporating a company along with allotment of DIN, PAN, TAN and the CIN is now just one day affair;\nPower connection is provided within a time frame of 15 days;\nIndia's ranking is now up by 111 places on 'Getting Electricity' parameter of World Bank\nThe above examples are also included in thousands of reforms done by the states. Along with the Federal Government, the states have also taken into consideration such reforms. I will give some examples:\nHere, I am mentioning about some states but due to an emotion of competition, the trend of reforms is spreading fast to all states.\nReforms include -\n100% implementation of single window system for payments \u0026 approvals in 16 states;\n100% implementation of e-filing of tax returns in 13 states;\nAutomated online building plan approval in 13 states;\nE-filing system for commercial disputes has been implemented in 11 states;\nSpecialized Commercial Courts have been established at District level in 13 states;\nFriends!\nNow, India has one of the most liberal FDI policy regimes in the world. More than 90% of foreign investment flows are under automatic route. Last week, we were formally decided to cancel the Foreign Investment Promotion Board which was made in 1990s to examine the FDI proposals. The idea is to expand the engagement of the Indian economy. Due to this approach, our FDI Outlook has been highly rated by various International Agencies.\nThere has also been tremendous growth in the FDI inflows in the last 3 years and has now reached 60 billion US Dollars in 2016-17.\nFriends!\nIndia is a big country So, nothing is possible We have many dreams And the dreams are big But we have small timelines And this is your chance\nThese opportunities range from building to hundreds of smart cities; modernization of railway networks and stations to setting up high speed rail corridors; generation of renewable energy In addition, there is an ever growing need for National Highways, Bridges, and Mass Urban Transport systems, schools, hospitals and skill training institutes.\nWe are trying to empower our people to realize this potential through our campaigns like Digital India and Skill India. To tap the youth energy fully, we have launched the Start up India and Stand up India Campaigns.\nChancellor Merkel and Friends!\nWhen I spoke in April 2015, our process of reform just started Now, I can say safely However, we are committed to do more and more; in a faster and better manner I strongly believe that we should create institutional networks to understand and advocate such reforms. This is essential to leverage the underlying economic potential of our two countries. At the end, I invite more and more German colleagues and companies to India\nOur direction, desire and dreams create tremendous business opportunity Never before, India was so much ready for business. We are on a take off stage. Moreover, our democratic values ​​and an alert judicial system will ensure the safety of your investments.\nI assure you that we will work in hand\nThank You!\nA great pleasure to meet you all It's an added pleasure to the leader of the Chancellor Merkel: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) May 30, 2017\nGermany is among India's most important partners both the bilaterally and in the global context: PM @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/Oi5TZSm9ZF\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) May 30, 2017\nThere is a tremendous potential in India-Germany economic collaboration.
