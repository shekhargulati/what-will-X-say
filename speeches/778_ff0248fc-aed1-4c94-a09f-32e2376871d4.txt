Today, their brilliant colors have made Delhi the most special place in the world.\nTo the 41 Heads of State and Government and other eminent leaders; to the hundreds of senior officers, business leaders and journalists from Africa, I say this: we are deeply, deeply honored by your presence today.\nTo our visitors\nFrom the Deserts of the North, where the glory of human civilization shines through the shifting sands of time;\nFrom the south, where the conscience of our age has been made - from Mahatma Gandhi to Albert Luthuli to Nelson Mandela;\nFrom the shores of Atlantic that has been history's tragic crossroads and now at the frontiers of many successes; From our neighbors on the resurgent east coast; From Africa's heart, where Nature is generous and culture is rich; And, from the sparkling gems of island states;\nA very warm embrace of welcome and friendship from India Today, it is not just a meeting of India and Africa Today, the dream of one-third Today, the heart beat of 1.25 billion Indians and 1.25 billion Africans are in rhythm.\nWe are the world's oldest civilizations. We are a vibrant mosaic of languages, religions and cultures.\nOur histories have intersected since ages. Once united by geography, we are now linked by the Indian Ocean. The currents of the mighty ocean have nurtured the ties of kinship, commerce, and culture through centuries.\nGenerations of Indians and Africans have travelled to each other's land in the search of their destiny or by the force of circumstances. Either way, we have enriched our ties.\nWe have lived in colonialism And, we have fought for our liberty and our dignity. We have struggled for opportunities, and also for justice, which, the African wisdom describes, is the prime condition of humanity.\nWe have a voice in the world; And, we have formed a partnership for prosperity among ourselves\nWe have stood together And, we have fought against hunger and disease.\nAnd, as we look forward, there is something precious that unites us: it is our young\nTwo-tenths of India and two-tenths of Africa is under the age of 35 years. And, if the future belongs to the youth, then this is ours to shape and build\nExcellencies, Africa is already on that path.\nWe are all familiar with Africa's ancient achievements. Now, its modern progress\nThe continent is more settled and stable African countries are coming together to take responsibility for their development, peace and security.\nAfrican struggles and sacrifices are upholding democracy, combating extremism and empowering women. Women now constitute around 20% of elected members of Parliament in Africa.\nTo one who has played a role in that, President Sirleaf, I extend our best wishes on your birthday today\nAfrica's economic growth has increased and has a more diversified base. African initiatives are replacing old fault lines with new economic growths.\nWe see many successful examples of economic reforms, infrastructure development and sustainable use of resources. They are turning into economics in dynamic ones.\nFour hundred thousand new businesses were registered in Africa in 2013; And, mobile phone now reaches 95% of the population in many places.\nAfrica is now joining the global mainstream of innovation. The mobile banking of M-Pesa, the healthcare innovation of MedAfrica, or the agricultural innovation of AgriManagr and Kilimo Salama, is using mobile and digital technology to transform lives in Africa.\nWe see strong measures that are radically improved healthcare, education and agriculture. Primary school enrollment in Africa now exceeds 90%\nAnd, across its magnificent landscape, Africa is setting standards in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism.\nAfrica's sports, art and music\nYes, Africa, like the rest of the developing world, has its development challenges And, like others in the world, it has its own concerns of security and stability, especially from terrorism and extremism.\nBut, I have confidence in African leadership and the African people\nExcellencies,\nfor the past six decades, so much of our independent journeys have been together\nNow, so much of India's development priorities and Africa's lofty vision for its future are aligned.\nToday, Africa and India are two bright spots of hope and opportunities in the global economy.\nIndia is proud to be a developer partner for Africa. It is a partnership beyond strategic concerns and economic benefits. It is the emotional bonds we share and the solidarity we feel for each other.\nIn less than a decade, our trade has more than doubled to over 70 billion dollars. India is now a major source of business investments in Africa. Today, 34 African countries enjoy duty free access to the Indian market.\nAfrican energy helps run the engine of the Indian economy; its resources are powering our industries; And, African prosperity offers growing products for Indian products.\nIndia has committed 7.4 billion dollars in concessional credit and 1.2 billion dollars in grant since the first India-Africa summit in 2008. It is making 100 capacity building institutions, and developing infrastructure, public transport, clean energy, irrigation, agriculture and manufacturing capacity across Africa\nIn the last three years alone, nearly 25,000 young Africans have been trained and educated in India. They are the 25,000 new links between us\nExcellencies,\nThere are times when we have not There have been occasions when we should not be as attentive as we should There are commitments we have not\nBut, you have always embraced India with warmth, and without judgement. You have rejoiced in our success, and taken pride in our achievements. And, you have stood for us in the world.\nThis is the strength of our partnership and our friendship\nAnd, as we travel on the road ahead, we will do with your guidance.\nWe will raise our vision for a prosperous, integrated, and united Africa.\nWe will help connect Africa from Cairo to Cape Town, from Marakesh to Mombassa; help develop your infrastructure, power and irrigation; help add value to your resources in Africa; and, set up industrial and information technology parks.\nExcellencies,\nAs the great Nigerian Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka insisted, human entity is the primary asset in overall development.\nOur approach is based on the same belief: that the best partnership is one that develops human capital and institutions; that equips and empowers a nation to have the freedom to make its own choices and shoulder the responsibility for its own progress. It also opens doors for opportunities for the youth\nSo, the development of human capital in every walk of life will be our partner. We will open tele-education; and we will continue to build institutions in Africa\nThe Egyptian Nobel Prize winning writer Naguib Mahfouz said, \"Science brings people together with its ideas ... and prods us towards a better future.\"\nThere is no better expression of the ability of science to unify people and advance progress.\nSo, technology will be a strong foundation of our partnership\nIt will help develop Africa's agriculture sector. Africa has 60% of the world's arable land reserves, and just 10% of the global output. Agriculture in Africa can drive the continent's march to prosperity, and also support global food security\nIndia's expertise in healthcare and affordable medicines can offer new hope in the fight against many diseases; and give a new opportunity to survive We will also collaborate to develop Indian and African treasures of traditional knowledge and medicines.\nWe will make available our space assets and technology We will use the possibilities of digital technology to transform development, public services, governance, disaster response, resource management and quality of life.\nWe will expand and extend the Pan Africa E-Network, conceived by late President APJ Abdul Kalam, which links 48 African countries to India and to each other. This will also set up your Pan Africa Virtual University.\nWe will work to reduce digital divide within Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world\nWe will cooperate for sustainable development of Blue Economy\nFor me, Blue Economy is part of a big Blue Revolution to reclaim our blue sky and blue waters, as we move on the path of clean development.\nExcellencies,\nWhen the sun sets, tens of millions of homes in India and Africa become dark We want to light our lives\nBut, we want to do it in a way that the snow on Kilimanjaro does not disappear, the glacier that feeds the river Ganges do not retreat and our islands are not doomed.\nNo one has done less to contribute to global warming than India and Africa No one can be more conscious of climate change than Indians and Africans\nThis is because we are the inheritors of Nature's most precious gifts, and of traditions that respect them the most. And, our life remains connected to Mother Earth\nWe are making great efforts for our modest resources to combat climate change. For India, 175 Gigawatts of additional renewable energy capacity by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity by 33-35% by 2030 are just two aspects of our efforts.\nWe will also deepen India-Africa partnership on clean energy, sustainable habitats, public transport and climate resilient agriculture.\nBut, it is also true that the burden of many So, when the world meets in Paris in December, we look to a comprehensive and concrete outcome that is based on the well established principles in the UN Convention on Climate Change. We will all But, we want to see a real global public partnership that makes clean energy affordable; Providing finance and technology to developing countries; and the means to adapt\nI also invite you to join an alliance of solar-rich countries, who have been invited to visit in Paris on November 30 at the time of the COP-21 meeting. Our goal is to make solar energy an integral part of our life and reach it the most unconnected villages and communities.\nIndia and Africa seek also seek a global trading regime that serves our development goals and improves our trade prospects.\nWhen we meet at Nairobi Ministerial of the WTO in December, we must ensure that the Doha Development Agenda of 2001 is not closed without achieving these fundamental objectives.\nWe should also get a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security and special safeguard mechanism in agriculture for the developing countries.\nExcellencies,\nThis is a milestone year when we are setting the agenda for our future and celebrating the 70th anniversary of the United Nations. The world is undergoing political, economic, technological and security transition on a scale and speed. Yet our global organizations reflect the situations of the century that we left behind, not the one we are in today.\nThese organizations have served well, but unless they are able to change the world, they are becoming irrelevant. We can not say\nBut, we might have a more fragmented world that is less capable of dealing with our challenges. That is why India advocates reforms in global institutions\nThis is a world of free nations and awakened aspirations. Our institutions can not be the representative of our world, if they do not give voice to Africa, with one-quarter of UN members, or one-sixth of humanity with world's largest democracy.\nThat is why India and Africa should speak in one voice for reforms of the United Nations, including its Security Council.\nExcellencies,\nToday, in many parts of the world, the light of a bright future flickers in the storm of violence and instability. When terror snuffs out life on the streets and beaches, and in malls and schools of Africa, we feel your pain as our own And, we see the links.\nWe also see that when our oceans are no longer safe for trade, we all suffer together\nAnd, when nations are caught in conflict within, no one around remains untouched\nAnd, we know that our cyber networks bring opportunities, but also carry huge risks.\nSo, when it comes to security, distance no longer insulates us from each other\nThat is why we want to deepen our cooperation in maritime security and hydrography, and countering terrorism and extremism; And, why we should have a UN-Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism\nWe will also provide support for Africa Union's peacekeeping efforts. And, we will train African peacekeepers here and in Africa. We must also have a strong voice in decisions on UN Peacekeeping Missions.\nExcellencies,\nFrom our connecting life to collaborating for our prosperity, from keeping our people safe to advancing our global interests, our linked aspirations of vast territory across our partnership stretches of agenda.\nTo add strength to our partnership, India will offer the concessional credit of 10 billion US dollars over the next five years This will be in addition to our ongoing credit program.\nWe will also offer a grant assistance of 600 million US dollars This will include an India-Africa Development Fund of 100 million US Dollars and an India-Africa Health Fund of 10 million US dollars\nIt will also include 50,000 scholarships in India over the next five years. And, it will support the expansion of the Pan Africa E-Network and institutions of skilling, training and learning across Africa.\nExcellencies,\nIf this century is going to be one in which all humans have a life of opportunity, equality and dignity; stand in peace with each other; and live in balance with nature, then India and Africa must rise together\nWe will work together:\nFrom the memory of our common struggles; and, the tide of our collective hopes;\nFrom the richness of our heritage; and, the commitment to our planet;\nFrom the pledge to our people; and, the faith in our future;\nFrom the generosity of the African saying that a small home can hold hundred friends;\nFrom the spirit of India's ancient belief: It is an indictment of itself: that great souls are always taking the initiatives to do good to others;\nFrom the inspiration of Mandela's call to live in a way that respected and enhances the freedom of others.\nToday, we are pledge to walk together, our steps in rhythm and our voices in harmony.\nThis is not a new journey, nor a new beginning. But, this is a great future for an ancient relationship.\nYour presence here today, Your Majesties and Excellencies, is the strongest proof of our resolution and our commitment.\nThank you! Thank you very much !!\n"
