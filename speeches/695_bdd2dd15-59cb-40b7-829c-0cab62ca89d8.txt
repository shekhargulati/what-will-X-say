The city has a special place in the heart of all Indians.\nMy last visit to Vishakhapatnam was in October of 2014.\nAt that time, Cyclone Hudhud had broken\nBut, the people of Vishakhapatnam smiled in the face of adversity.\nIt is a tribute to the city within 14 months, you have risen against all odds to welcome the Navies from across the continents in this International Fleet Review.\nA little over a year ago Today, thanks to the spirit of the people of Visakhapatnam, we are discussing how the oceans can be a source of economic prosperity for all of us.\nFor its courage and resolve, we all salute the city of Visakhapatnam.\nMy profuse thanks to the men and women of the Indian Navy for their tireless dedication for making this Fleet Review a truly historic success.\nMy sincere gratitude also to Chief Minister Chandrababu Naiduji for his strong support for the international event.\nFor me personally, witnessing the best of international tournaments.\nJust over three months ago in October, we welcomed in Delhi, for the first time ever, all the 54 African nations, including over 40 Heads of State for the 3rd India-Africa Summit.\nA few weeks ago in August 2015, India had hosted in Jaipur 14 Heads of the State for the Second Forum for India-Pacific Island Cooperation.\nJust day before yesterday, we welcomed all the SAARC countries for the 12th South Asian Games in Guwahati.\nAnd today it is our pleasure to welcome 50 foreign navies from every corner of the globe at India's second international flight review- the first one on India's East Coast.\nYour participation is a message of cooperation and friendship that we deeply cherish.\nOn behalf of my countrymen, I would like to thank you all for accepting this invitation.\nTo build on the gains from today's gathering, India will host the first ever Global Maritime Summit in the month of April this year.\nIts priority would be to scale up and strengthen the vibrant trade / investment / technology and commercial linkages between India and other marine countries.\nFriends,\nThe oceans and world's waterways are global commons. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam- The concept of whole world as a family - is probably the most vividly seen on the oceans of the planet, that connect we all\nThe last time India hosted the International Fleet Review in the year 2001, in the city of Mumbai.\nThe world of 2016 is vastly different\nIts politics is turbulent, and its challenges complex\nAt the same time, the oceans are the lifelines of global prosperity They present themselves with great economic opportunities.\nOver 90% of global merchandise trade is carried on the oceans.\nOver the last 15 years, its value has grown from about 6 trillion dollars to about 20 trillion dollars.\nOceans are critical for the global energy security as 60% of world's oil production moves through sea routes.\nOur ability to reap economic benefits from the oceans rests on our capacity to respond to the challenges of the marine domain.\nThe threat of sea borne terror, which India has given as a direct victim, continues to endanger the regional and global peace and stability.\nPiracy too remains a strong challenge\nThe threat of natural disasters like tsunamis and cyclones is ever present.\nManmade problems such as oil spills, climate change continue to risk the stability of the marine domain.\nA peaceful and stable marine environment is, therefore, critical for the regional and global security. It is also a must to harvest the oceanic ecosystems.\nGiven the scale and complexity of modern day challenges, the international maritime sustainability can not be a protective of a single nation.\nIt has to be a shared goal and responsibility.\nTo this end, the navies and maritime agencies of the world need to work together, and engineer virtuous cycles of cooperation.\nBut, where necessary, they also need to be\nI believe that if oceans were to propel our economies, then we must:\n• Use seas to build peace, friendship and trust, and curb conflict;\n• respect and ensure freedom of navigation; and\n• Cooperate, not compete in the challenges\nThe large presence of foreign navies at the Fleet Review is a confirmation of our shared interest in the pathways of peace and cooperation for the marine domain safe and secure.\nFriends,\nIndia is, and has always been, a maritime nation\nIndia's ancient Sanskrit texts also refer to the oceans as the storehouse of Chaturdashanam Ratnanam, the 14 jewels.\nSurrounded by sea from three sides, India has a long coastline of over 7500 kilometer.\nWe have been blessed with a rich maritime heritage since since. Lothal in Gujarat became one of the earliest sea ports of the world.\nIndia's central location in the Indian Ocean has been associated with other cultures, shaped our maritime trade routes, India's strategic thinking, and our marine character defined.\nSince the days of the Indus Valley Civilization, India has maintained a broad network of maritime links, including Africa, Western Asia, the Mediterranean region, the West, South East Asia and the Far East.\nWe are delighted that the Navies from all these regions have joined in the Fleet Review.\nThe Photo Essay book on the 'Maritime Heritage of India', that I have just released, showcases this glorious maritime tradition.\nFriends,\nIn moderntimes too, the oceans, especially the Indian Ocean, occupy a vital place in India's national security and economic prosperity.The waters of the Indian Ocean touch the shores of over 40 countries.\nAbout half of world's container traffic; and close to one-third of world's cargo traffic passes through this region.\n90% of our trade by volume and 90% of our oil imports are carried on the seas.\nIndia's 1200 island territories, and our huge Exclusive Economic Zone of 2.4 million square kilometers makes clear the economic significance of the Indian Ocean.\nFor us, it also serves as a strategic bridge with our immediate and extended maritime neighbourhood.\nIn March last year, in Mauritius, I had spelled out our vision for the Indian Ocean.\nThe Indian Ocean Region is one of my foremost policy priorities. Our approach is clear in our vision of \"Sagar\", which means \"Ocean\" and stands for - Security and Growth for All in the Region.\nWe would continue to pursue and promote our geo-political, strategic and economic interests on the seas, in particular the Indian Ocean.\nTo this end, India's modern and multi-dimensional navy leads from the front. It is a force for peace and good\nA network of growing political and economic maritime partnerships, and strengthening of regional frameworks\nFriends,\nIndia's quest for economic prosperity through oceans is a part of our big efforts to transform India.\nWe are not the only one Regionally and internationally, we are a pillar of stability and an important growth center.\nIndia's rise is in harmony with the goal of maintaining the regional and global peace and security.\nWithin the country, there is great optimism, enthusiasm and a \"can do\" mindset.\nThis optimism comes from our energy youth\nIt also comes from our bold and sustainable measures to transform our country, improve our laws, processes and institutions.\nWe are launching new initiatives and creating opportunities for empower people, and give them an understanding of ownership in nation's progress.\n\"Make in India\"\nDefense production and ship building are among its focus areas.\nIn a week from now, on 13 February, we will hold 7 days of global engagement under \"Make in India\" in Mumbai.\nDuring this time, the best in the global industry will link up with the innovation, design and manufacturing opportunities of India- the world's fastest growing economy.\nWe want to invite the world to Make in India, Make for India, and Make for the World.\nWe take pride in the fact that all Indian Naval ships participating in this Fleet Review, at least 37 are \"Made in India\" - a number that will certainly rise in the coming years.\nOur \"Skill India\" program is building institutions that train, support, encourage and guide our 800 million youth on the path of entrepreneurship.\nOur skilled youth are ready to respond to the national and global manpower demands of the 21st century.\nAn important part of India's transformation is \"Blue Economy\"\nThe Blue Chakra - or the wheel - in our National Flag, represents the potential of the Blue Economy.\nAn important part of this pursuit is the development of India's coastal and island territories: but, not just for tourism\nWe want to build new pillars of economic activity in the coastal areas and in linked hinterlands through sustainable tapping of oceanic resources.\nStrengthening our marine research, development of eco-friendly, marine industrial and technology base, and fisheries are other elements of our goal.\nIn this endeavor, I see youth in the coastal areas as our true assets. They have a natural and deep understanding of the Oceans\nThey could lead in the way\nIn partnership with all coastal states of India, I would like to take a special program of skilling India's youth in the coastal areas of the country.\nFriends,\nIn the end, let me once again congratulate the Indian Navy for the flawless conduct of this grand event.\nFor the homeward journey of all our Naval friends from across the world, you may always have fair winds, following seas, and many a fathom below your keel.\nThank You\nJai hind!\nI am privileged to visit Vishakhapatnam.
