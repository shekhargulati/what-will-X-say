We are truly happy\nRivers have been bears of great civilisations of the world. In the flow of rivers\nIn the Holy Quran, the image of Paradise\nIn the ancient scriptures of India, rivers defined as our nation and were celebrated as the Giver of life\nAnd, it is a wise Afghan proverb that says, Kabul is going to be berbe ne: May Kabul be without gold instead of snow\nFor the snow feeds the rivers that sustain life and agriculture.\nSo, today, we are only launching a project that will irrigate the land and light up homes.\nWe are reviving a region, restoring hope, renewing life and redefining Afghanistan's future.\nThe dam is a generator not only of electricity but also of optimism and belief in the future of Afghanistan.\nThe project did not just irrigate the fields of six hundred and forty villages in Chiste, Obe, Pashtun Zarghun, Karokh, Gozara, Injil, Zindjan, Kohsan and Ghoryan.\nIt will also bring light to over two hundred and fifty thousand homes in this area.\nLast December, in Kabul, I was moved by the honor of inauguration the Afghan Parliament Building.\nIt was a tribute to the epic struggle of the Afghan people to make their future by vote and debate, not gun and violence. On this summer day, in Herat, we came together to honor and celebrate Afghan determination to build a future of prosperity. Afghans and Indians dreamt of this project in the seventies The lost decades\nIt was a war not of Afghan making, but it was one that stole the future of a whole generation of Afghans.\nAnd, when a new dawn broke over Afghanistan in 2001, we resumed the project.\nWith resolve and patience, courage and belief, we have overcome the distance and hurdles, threats and violence. Today, the brave Afghan people are sending a message that destruction and death, denial and domination, will not prevail.\nThey will not come in the way\nThe fields that produce the finest fruits and saffron will once again come alive with the clear waters of the river.\nThe homes that live through the night\nMen and women will once again work the farms and ply their trade with the joy of hard work, peace and security. The shoulders that were once weighed down in the shadow of guns will now bear ploughs to turn the ground green.\nChildren will again believe in a future of education and opportunity.\nAnd, another young girl who does not have a life of pain, denial and longing, or see a life of promise cut short. Herat is time and again seen sublime glory and tragic ruin. And, the city that once is Jalaluddin Rumi hold as the finest, will rise again.\nThe city that was the gateway to the west, South and Central Asia, will once again be the hub that will be a peaceful pursuit of prosperity.\nSo, to the people and Government of Herat and the Government of Afghanistan, I express our deepest appreciation for your support, patience and understanding - and, above all, your belief in us.\nThis dam has not been built by bricks and mortar, but by the faith of our friendship and the valor of Afghans and Indians. And, at this moment of pride, we also stand in grief and gratitude for the sacrifices, so that Afghan people have a future they are very rich and so deeply desire\nThe blood, sweat and tears of our people are mixed in this earth and have formed between us an eternal bond.\nBonds that remind us of ancient links between this region and India\nFor many, the Harirud River is one of the strings of the ancient Vedic times.\nToday, the world will see the Harirud River as an abiding symbol of our commitment to a shared future of progress. And, The Friendship Dam unites us in solidarity as Chishti Sharif joined us in spirit centuries ago.\nFor, it is here from that Chishti Silsila or Chishti tradition of Sufism came to India. Its glorious tradition and teachings resonate through the dargahs of Ajmer, Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri.\nIt draws people from all faiths with its message of love, peace, compassion; of the people of all God's creations; and service to humanity\nIndians and Afghans know that these values, not extremism and violence, define Afghanistan - a nation brimming with poetry of love and spiritual tradition of peace and harmony\nAnd, these are the values ​​that give the best Afghan people the patience and persistence to seek peace of their own.\nAfghans have pursued this path, despite their strength of their belief that they can defend their freedom like no other people on this earth.\nAnd, it is the foundation of these values ​​that Afghans and Indians seek a second, not because they harbor designs against another.\nKhwaja Moiunuddin Chishti, the first of the Chishti saints in India, said that human beings must have the love of the sun, the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth.\nHe was the magnificent land of his land in his land, he could also be describing the Afghan people. So, when I came to Kabul in December, I saw the kindness of your heart.\nIn your clear eyes, I saw the deep well\nIn your smiles, I saw the joy of this relationship\nIn the firmness of your embrace, I feel\nAnd, those memorable hours, India witnessed once again the grace of your people, the beauty of the land and the friendship of a nation\nToday, I return with the gratitude and admiration of 1.25 billion people.\nAnd, a renewed pledge for our partnership\nTogether, our partnership has built schools, health centers and irrigation facilities for rural communities.\nIt has been empowered women with skills and the youth\nWe have joined hands to build roads that bridge the distance of your country, from Zaranj to Delaram, and transmission lines that bring power to your homes.\nNow, India's investment in the port at Chahbahar in Iran will give Afghanistan a new route to prosperity.\nAnd, to implement that vision, just last month, President Ghani joined President Rouhani of Iran and me in witnessing the signing of the Chahbahar Trade and Transit Agreement between Afghanistan, Iran and India.\nThe fruits of our friendship are not confined to Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar and Herat. They will never be\nOur cooperation will extend to every part of Afghanistan Our partnership will benefit every section of Afghan society\nBecause across its difficult geography, and across its diversity, and beyond the identities as Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras, Afghanistan must live and prosper as one.\nFor, divisions among Afghan people will only help those people from out of the country\nAs we work together, we encourage you\nWhen our people are attacked, the brave Afghans guard us as their own. They put themselves in the line of fire so that their Indian friends are safe.\nThis is the nobleness of your friend.\nI have seen this from the Prime Minister.\nFor on that day, when terrorists launched a great attack on our Consulate in this city of Herat, the warrior efforts of Afghan soldiers, and of our personnel, saved many lives and prevented a big tragedy.\nMr. President, Friends,\nAfghanistan's success is a deeply held hope and desire of every Indian It's the love and admiration for Afghans in our hearts.\nWe want to see your democracy strike deep roots; your people unite; and, your economy prosper\nWe want to see your art, culture and poetry. And, we want to see your cricketers join the ranks of test players and also seek glory in IPL.\nBut, it also comes from the recognition that when Afghanistan succeeds, the world will be safe and more beautiful. When the values ​​that define Afghans prevail, terrorism and extremism will be retreat.\nBecause we know that extremism and terrorism can not stop at our border\nSo, in the spreading of our times, the world can not forget the brave struggle that the Afghan people are waging - for themselves and our world\nIndia will not forget or turn away\nAs I said then, and I will say it again, your friendship is our honor; your dreams are our duty\nIndia's capacity can be limited, but our commitment is without limits.\nOur resources may be modest, but our will is limitless\nFor others, their commitments may have a sunset clause, but our relationship is timeless.\nWe face barriers of geography and politics, but we define our path from the clarity of our purpose.\nWe see resistance and suspicion of others, but our resolve is strong and your faith and trust guides us forward.\nWhere some doubt your future, we are certain that no force or power can deny the Afghan people the destiny they have chosen.\nSo, on international platforms and in regional forums, we will speak in one voice for the Afghan right to a peaceful, prosperous, united, inclusive and democratic nation.\nAnd, in the fields, villages and cities of Afghanistan, we will work together for that future.\nAnd, whatever happens, in a bright or a dark moment, we will always experience, as Herat's great Sufi Poet, Hakim Jami, will say, the freshness and happiness of the gentle breeze of friendship.\nThank you for this honor\nThank you."
