"\nHon'ble Prime Minister Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, distinguished guests,\nTo our naval personnel from India, our guardian of the seas, who are here today - my special greetings to you.\nIt is a great honor to commission the Barracuda today in the service of the National Coast Guard of Mauritius.\nThank you for this privilege. India as your partner\nThis ship has made a long journey - from Kolkata to the great arc of Indian Ocean to the beautiful coast.\nGenerations ago, people from India charted that course to a new destination and a new life.\nToday, Barracuda brings his goodwill and greetings of the people of India.\nShe represents our unique trust and confidence.\nShe reflects our partnership\nShe is a symbol of our shared commitment to peace and security in Indian Ocean- our common maritime home.\nBarracuda is a beautiful ship. She is also capable; and built to specifications of Mauritius\nNow, she sailed proudly with the flag of Mauritius. She will protect your islands and your waters. She is going to help\nBut, she will do more than that She will also help make our Indian Ocean safe and more secure.\nIn doing so, Mauritius will fulfill an important international responsibility, because the Indian Ocean is critical to the future of the world. This Ocean bears two-thirds of world shipments, one-third of its bulk cargo; and half of its container traffic Over three-fourths of its traffic\nThe vast Indian Ocean Region hosts over 40 states and nearly 40% of the world`s population. It touches Australia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and the eastern seaboard of Africa. It sparkles with the gems of island states.\nThink of the civilisational links, yet great diversity in this vast region! Think about the opportunities!\nToday, the world speaks of 21st century driven by the dynamism and the energy of Asia and the Pacific. But, its course will be determined by the Indian Ocean. This is why the Indian Ocean is the center of global attention more than ever before.\nWe also see growing global stakes and presence in the Ocean. Even in this changing world, the oceans hold the key to its fortunes. And, we will all prosper when the seas are safe, secure and free for all.\nTo do this will be our greatest collective responsibility But, we will also have to deal with other challenges that are not uncommon in our region.\nWe have seen the tragedy of tsumanis and cyclones.\nTerror has visited us from sea Piracy has taken over the lives and trade on a scale that has been beyond belief in modern era.\nIllegal fishing and oil spills hurt our economies We all feel the growing influence of climate change on our coasts and islands.\nWe have also seen that the astability and the turmoil in coastal and island states can have profound impact on security on the seas.\nIndia is the crossroads of Indian Ocean.\nSince Lothal in Gujarat became one of the earliest seaports in the world, India had a long maritime tradition.\nOur cultural footprints stretch across Asia and Africa We see this in our strong Diaspora across the oceans.\nThe seas forged links of commerce, culture, and religion with our extended neighbors across several millenniums.\nOur more recent history is our focus on our continental neighborhood.\nBut, India has been shaped in more ways by the seas around us.\nToday, 90% of our trade by volume and 90% of our oil imports take place through sea. We have coastline of 7500 km, 1200 islands and 2.4 million square kilometers of Exclusive Economic Zone.\nIndia is becoming more integrated globally We will be more dependent than before\nWe should also assume our responsibility to shape its future.\nSo, the Indian Ocean region is at the top of our policy priorities.\nOur vision for Indian Ocean region is rooted in advancing cooperation in our region; and, to use our capabilities for our common maritime home\nIt means many things\nOne, we will do everything safeguard our mainland and islands and defend our interests.\nEqually we will work to ensure a safe, secure and stable Indian Ocean Region.\nAnd, our capabilities will be the waves of the sea Or, caught in distress on the seas\nSecond, we will deepen our economic and security cooperation with our friends in the region, especially our marine neighbors and island states.\nWe will continue to build their maritime security capacities and their economic strength.\nThree, collective action and cooperation It will also be ready to respond to emergency\nThat is why, in 2008, India promoted the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium. Today, it brings together 35 navies of the region Our goal is to deepen our mutual understanding on maritime challenges; And, strengthen our collective ability to address them\nWe also support efforts to strengthen our regional mechanisms for maritime cooperation - from dealing with piracy terrorism and other crimes; to marine safety and natural disasters\nIndia has also started maritime security cooperation with Maldives and Sri Lanka and we hope that Mauritius, Seychelles and other countries in the region will also join this initiative.\nFour, we also seek a more integrated and cooperative future in the region\nWe must promote more collaboration in trade, tourism and investment; infrastructure development; marine science and technology; sustainable fisheries; protection of marine environment; And, overall development of Ocean or Blue Economy\nTo the blue chakra or wheel in India's national flag represents the potential of Blue Revolution or the Ocean Economy That is how the central economy\nFor those who live by the sea, climate change is not an issue. We must assume leadership in our region and call for a more concerted and fair global action.\nOur Indian Ocean Rim Association is a sustainable and prosperous future in the region.\nRegional groupings around landmass The time has come for a strong grouping around the Indian Ocean. We will pursue this new vigour in the years ahead.\nThere is no better place to host the Secretariat for IORA than Mauritius. I am happy that the Secretary General is from India.\nFive, those who live in this region have the primary responsibility for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean\nBut, we recognize that there are other countries around the world, with strong interests and stakes in the region\nIndia is deeply engaged with them We do this through dialogue, visits, exercises, capacity building and economic partnership.\nOur goal is to get a climate of trust and transparency; respect for international maritime rules and norms by all countries; sensitivity to everyother's interests; peaceful resolution of maritime issues; and increase in maritime cooperation\nWe seek a future for Indian Ocean that lives up to the SAGAR - Security and Growth for All in the Region.\nWe should be inspired by Monsoon, who will be in the region\nWe will strive to unite our region in partnership, as we were once in geography.\nAn Ocean that connects our world will become the pathway of peace and prosperity for all.\nIt is no coincidence that I hope for the Indian Ocean Region in Mauritius.\nOur partnership with Mauritius is our strongest maritime relations in the world\nOur partnership will grow We will come build our capabilities We will also train and patrol the seas together.\nBut, the foundation of this partnership is big It is our shared values ​​and a common vision.\nIt is our willingness to look beyond our own domain\nMauritius is a strong and sustainable future for the Indian Ocean. We are your partner\nThank you very much, and wish you all the best"
