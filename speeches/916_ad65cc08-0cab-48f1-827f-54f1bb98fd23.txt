"I am truly honored to address UNESCO\nI feel specially privileged to visit this great institution in its 70th anniversary year.\nThis milestone reminds us of a fundamental achievement of our age: for the first time in human history, we have an organization for the whole world - the United Nations.\nAnd, through the sweeping change of these decades, through many challenges of our times, and the great progress of this era, the organization has endured and grown\nThere has been doubts and skepticism There is need for urgent reforms\nBut, for the nations that came together at its birth; and, for three times as many that join it later, there is one unshakeable belief:\n\"Our world is and will remain a better place because of the United Nations.\"\nIt is this faith that has given birth to so many of its organizations\nOur collective goal is to seek a peaceful and prosperous future for our world, in which every nation has a voice;\nall people have an identity;\nAll cultures are flowers in a garden;\nevery human being has a life of dignity;\nevery child\nand our planet\nNo organization serves our cause more than this one\nThe seeds of our collective destiny are sown in human minds.\nIt is nurtured by the light of education and the spirit of inquiry.\nIt makes progress through the marvels of science.\nAnd, it draws from the basic character of the harmony and unity in diversity.\nThat is why UNESCO was the first missions of the United Nations.\nThat is why India values ​​the work of UNESCO so deeply; And, cherishes our partnership so immensely\nI am conscious of the extraordinary legacy of our time from UNESCO's birth.\nI recall Mahatma Gandhi's message to UNESCO, calling for urgent action to address the needs of education;\nAnd, the leadership of Dr. Radhakrishnan, later our first President, in the early years of this institution.\nWe are grateful for UNESCO's support for education and science, in India and for the preservation of our cultural heritage.\nEqually, we have been privileged to work with UNESCO in support of its mission around the world.\nFor, in the challenges India faces and the dreams that Indians seek, our approach mirrors the ideals of UNESCO.\nWe have built a modern state in an ancient land, with a timeless tradition of openness and co-existence; And, a society of exceptional diversity\nThe foundation of our Constitution rests on a fundamental principle: the peace and prosperity of all indivisible from the welfare of the individual;\nThe strength of the nation is determined by the hand of every citizen;\nAnd, the real progress is\nThis has been our creed since we assumed office almost a year ago.\nAnd, we will judge our statistics, and we will judge them.\nFor me, it means many things\nWe will defend and protect the rights and liberty of every citizen.\nWe will ensure that every citizen, of every religion, culture and creed has a equal place in our society; belief in her future; and the confidence to pursue it\nEducation always had a special place in our tradition\nAs our ancient saying goes, it is\nVyattte and Nityya, Vyay Dhan\nThe wealth that increases by giving, that wealth is\nWe have launched the most important programs for our youth; and education for every child in the remotest villages\nOur progress will remain a mirage unless women are no longer suffering from fear, or barriers to chance; And, when they are no longer victims of exclusion and prejudice And, this change should start\nSo, the program to educate and support the girl child in India is one that is close to my heart. We will confirm that they can go to school; and, also, that they\nToday, the digital age has created opportunities beyond imagination; But, digital divide can extend disparities.\nOn the other hand, digital connectivity and smart phones have created a revolution of possibilities to educate, deliver services and extend development.\nThis is the most exciting change in our era.\nOur Digital India will create a participative, transparent and responsive government, connected to the citizens. And, we have launched a digital literacy mission to connect every 600,000 villages.\nThe link between habitat and fulfillment of human potential is deep and strong.\nSo, the highest priority for my government is to provide a roof over every head; power in every house; sanitation and clean water within everyone's reach; a hope for every child to survive; and a chance for every child\nIt also means clean rivers, air that we can breathe\nTo achieve these goals, we need not just policies and resources, but even more the power of science.\nFor us, science is driven by human development; and, for a safe, sustainable, prosperous future for India\nScience also unites people across a shared purpose.\nAnd, when we share its fruits with those who do not have it, we connect lives and make our world a better place.\nIndia never forgets the help we have received in our early years; Today, we are fulfilling our responsibility to others.\nTherefore, science is a key priority of India's international engagement.\nCulture is a sublime expression of a people; and, the foundations of a society\nUNESCO's initiatives to save the world's cultural heritage, including in India, are inspiring\nWe see India's rich and diverse cultural heritage as humanity's wealth.\nAnd, we will do everything\nWe have launched 'Heritage Development and Augmentation Scheme - HRIDAY or heart in Hindi - to protect our cities\nWe have started a special scheme called \"PRASAD\" - or offerings - Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spirituality Augmentation Drive \"for rejuvenation of our pilgrim centers\".\nMadam Chairman,\nI speak of our vision and initiatives, because in our own aspirations and efforts, we see the value of UNESCO to our world with great clarity.\nIn the challenges of our times, we see its sense of urgency\nThe fault lines in our world are shifting from the boundaries of nations in our societies and the streets of our cities\nThe threats are changing from domination by states to destruction by groups.\nWe fight today not only on what we claim, but also for who we are\nAnd, in many parts of the world, culture remains a source of conflict.\nWe have access to a mouse.\nWe live in a world of information\nYet, we know that familiarity does not always lead to fraternity; or reduce prejudice\nWhen Ebola threatens an entire region; the fury of unseasonal storms destroys crops and lives; And, diseases are still our most courageous fight, we know how fragile we are\nWhen we see people living at the edge of existence; children shut out of classrooms; And, nations without the human resources to shoulder the responsibility of progress, we know that we still have a long way to go.\nTo be sure, our world has made incredible progress over seven decades. So, our progress should be our challenges\nUNESCO can play an important role in addressing them.\nCulture must connect, not divide, our world\nIt should be a bridge\nIt should join countries in peace and harmony Across India's neighbourhood, Asia and Indian Ocean, we are retracing our cultural connections to form a closer bond of friendship in this dynamic area.\nWe must turn deep into our cultures; traditions; and religions; to overcome the rising tide of extremism, violence, and divisions across the world\nWe must intensify the exchange of the seeds of a more peaceful world.\nCultures too Societies across the world\nAnd, they hold the secrets to economic, efficient, and, environmentally friendly solutions.\nBut, today they are at risk of extinction in our globalized world.\nSo, we must make more efforts to revive, preserve and nurture traditional knowledge.\nThis will also redefine a fundamental truth about human civilization: as our cultures are varied, knowledge has many sources.\nIn doing so, we will give ourselves challenges\nWe must do more to harness science for human welfare in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world - specially for health and food security.\nClimate change is a pressing global challenge And, it calls for a collective human action; and, a comprehensive response.\nWe will draw on our full wealth of wisdom; the strength of every institution; all possibilities of innovation; and, the power of science\nIn India, Faith and Nature had had a deep link since ancient times.\nFor us, the only path to prosperity is the sustainable one.\nWe make this choice with the natural instincts of our culture and tradition. But, we also have a commitment to our future.\nWe have, for example, set a target of adding 175,000 MW of clean and renewable energy in the next seven years.\nToo often, our discussion is reduced to an argument about emission cuts. But, we are more likely to succeed, not just impose choices.\nThat is why I have spoken to global public action to develop clean energy, that is affordable and accessible to all.\nAnd, it is the same reason that I call for a change in lifestyle. Because, the emission reduction that we want to enjoy\nAnd, it will also mean a different path to economic well being.\nIt is the vision that I had called the United Nations General Assembly last September to announce June 21 as the International Day of Yoga.\nYoga awakens a sense of oneness and harmony with self, society and Nature. By changing our lifestyle and making consciousness, it can help\nLast December, the UNGA adopted it with a record time in a record time.\nIt was not just an act of friendship for India It reflected our collective ability to go beyond our familiar boundaries in search for solutions to common challenges\nThe campaign to clean our Ganges River is a mission that connects culture, science, traditional knowledge, education, economy, and, environment; But, it is also about attitudes and lifestyles.\nMadam Chairperson,\nOutside this hall, I paid respect at the statue of a great Indian philosopher and sage, Mr. Aurobindo.\nThere is much that we can learn from his humanism and spiritualism, from his belief in the unity; the enlightened purpose of education; the service of science; and, the unity of world, established on national independence, diversity of civilizations and autonomy of culture.\nIt is a guiding spirit for the institution - the defense of the mind in men.\nThe 70th anniversary is a moment to celebrate our remarkable journey so far. It is also a time to look ahead with wisdom\nWhatever we wish to achieve as United Nations, UNESCO will always have a part to play - whether it is sustainable development, our post-2015 agenda, climate change or peace and security.\nUNESCO's responsibilities to our future have become bigger; And, so our resolve should be strong\nThank you very much for this opportunity\nThank you."
