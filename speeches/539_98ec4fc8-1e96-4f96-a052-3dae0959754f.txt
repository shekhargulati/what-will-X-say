Centered around:\n- ease of doing business\n-making governance transparent and efficient\n-reducing regulatory overburden\nPresently, cleaning the system from black money and corruption is very high on my agenda.\nThis comes close after digitization and introduction of GST.\nThe outcomes of our efforts are visible from India's global rankings on various indicators.\nIndia's ranking has gone up in World Bank's Doing Business Report\nWe are fast closing the gap between business practices in India and the best in the world.\nWe are ranked third in the list of prospective host economies for

Dollars 130 billion.\nHighest ever FDI inflows\nThe increase in FDI equity inflows in the last two financial years was 52 per cent as compared to previous two financial years.\nSources and sectors in

economy.\nOur licensing regime has been greatly rationalised.\nWe have launched Single Window Interfaces for registering a business, EXIM clearances and labor compliance.\nProcedures involved in

proceedings.\n\nFriends\nIndia is currently buzzing with entrepreneurial activity like never before.\nStart-ups are the next big economic force in India and are not less than a revolution.\nOur Start-Up India program aims to improve our ability in this area.\nOur economic process is being geared towards activities which are vital for generating employment or self-employment opportunities.\nThis is the only way to reap the demographic dividend.\nThrough the 'Skill India' initative and its various components, we are trying to synergise the skills to the market requirements.\nBuilding Futuristic Infrastructure\nWe are developing a pentagon of industrial corridors across the country.\nThere is an amazing focus on removing the logistic constraints.\nRoads,
