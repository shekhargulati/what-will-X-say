"Share\n\nToday, we have got the privilege of honoring Bharat Ratna with the inspiration of Mother Bharti, Laddle, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji, who dedicated his life to Bharat Bhakti. I am very grateful to the President that he himself came here, and Atalji was honored with Bharat Ratna in Ru-Ba-Ru. Atalji's life was dedicated to the nation. They keep thinking for the moment, the nation, for the nation. And crores of like me in Hindustan are such workers, in whose life Vajpayee ji is an inspiration. The coming generations will also get their inspiration. The life of Vajpayee Ji, who received this Bharat Ratna award, kept giving us inspiration and guidance forever - I would pray to the Lord."
