The theme of this year's Congress is \"Science and Technology for Indigenous Development in India.\"\nThe Prime Minister released the 103rd ISC Plenary Proceedings, and the Technology Vision 2035 document. He has given away the ISCA Awards for 2015-16.\nFollowing is the text of the Prime Minister's address:\nGovernor of Karnataka Shri Vajubhai Vala\nChief Minister of Karnataka, Shri Siddaramaiah\nMy cabinet colleagues, Dr. Harsh Vardhan and Mr. Y.S.Chowdary\nBharat Ratna Professor C.N.R. Rao\nProf. A.K.Saxena;\nNobel Laureates and Field Medalist\nDistinguished scientists and delegates,\nIt is a great pleasure to begin the year in the company of leaders of science and technology.\nFor our confidence about the future of India\nIt is a great honor and privilege to address the 103rd Science Congress in the centennial year of the University of Mysore.\nSome of the tallest leaders of India have passed the respected institution.\nThe great philosopher and India's second President Dr. Radhakrishnan and Bharat Ratna Professor CNR Rao are among them\nThe History of the Science Congress and the University of Mysore started around the same time.\nIt was the time of a new awakening in India. It seeks not just freedom but also human advancement in India.\nIt wanted not just an independent India, but an India that could stand independently on the strength of its human resources, scientific capabilities and industrial development.\nThis university is a testimony to the vision of a great generation of Indians.\nNow, we have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in India\nAnd, we are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development.\nThe world has progressed because of human challenges.\nMore than late President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam\nHis was a life of outstanding scientific achievements; and, his was a heart of boundless compassion and concern for humanity.\nFor him, the supreme purpose of science was the transformer of the poor, the under-privileged and the youth.\nAnd, his life's mission was a self-reliant and a self-assured India that was strong and cared for its people.\nYour theme for this is a fitting tribute to his vision.\nAnd, it is like leaders like Professor Rao and President Kalam, and scientists like you, who have placed India at the forefront of science and technology in many areas.\nOur success spans from the vast frontier of space. We have enhanced food and health safety; And, we have given a better life to others in the world.\nAs we increase the level of our ambitions, we will also have the scale of our efforts.\nSo, for me, good governance is not just about policy and decision making, transparency and accountability. It is also about integrating science and technology in the choices we make and the strategies we pursue.\nOur digital networks are expanding the quality of services and social benefits for the poor. And, in the first ever National Space Conference, we identified 170 applications that were to be used in almost every aspect of governance, development and conservation.\nWe are launching Startup India We are making technology incubators in academic institutions And, I have asked for a framework of Scientific Audit for scientific departments and institutions in the government.\nIt is the same spirit of cooperative federalism that is shaping center-state relations in every area, that I am encouraging greater scientific collaboration between Central and State institutions and agencies.\nWe will try to increase the level of resources, and deploy them in accordance with our strategic priorities,\nWe will make it easy to do science and research in India, improve science administration, and expand the supply and improve the quality of science education and research in India.\nAt the same time, innovation should not just be the goal of our science. Innovation must also drive Frugal innovation and crowd sourcing are examples of efficient and effective scientific enterprise.\nAnd, innovation in approach is not just the obligation of the government, but also the responsibility of the private sector and the academia.\nIn a world of resource constraints and competing claims, we have to be smart in defining our priorities. And, it is especially important in India, where the challenges are many and the scale is enormous - from health and hunger to energy and economy.\nDistinguished delegates,\nToday, I want to tell you about one of the biggest challenges for the world, and one that dominated global attention last year - to define a path to a more prosperous future for our world and a more sustainable future for our planet.\nIn 2015, the world took two historic steps.\nLast September, the United Nations adopted the Development Agenda for 2030. It places elimination of poverty by the end of 2030 and economic development at the top of our priorities, but with equal emphasis on sustainability of our environment and our habitats.\nAnd, last November in Paris, the world came together to craft a historic agreement.\nBut, we achieved something else\nWe succeeded in bringing innovation and technology into the environment.\nWe were consistent in our message It is necessary to find solutions.\nI also said in Paris that the innovation is important not just for the combating climate change, but also for justice For, the developed world needs to grow\nFor this, we need research and innovation to make clean energy technology available, accessible and affordable for all.\nAt Paris, President Hollande, President Obama and I joined a number of global leaders for an innovation summit.\n\nWe are pledged to double national investments in innovation; And, build a global partnership that combines the responsibilities of the private sector.\nI also suggested an international network of 30-40 universities and labs for the next ten years on transforming the way we produce, distribute and consume energy. We will continue pursue this in 20\nWe need innovation to make much cheaper; more reliable; And, easy to connect to transmission grids\nThis is especially critical for India to achieve our target of adding 175 GW of renewable generation by 2022.\nWe should also make fossil fuel like coal cleaner and more efficient. And, we should have newer sources of renewable energy, from ocean waves to geothermal energy.\nAt a time when energy sources that fueled the industrial age has put our planet in peril, and, as the developing world now seeks to lift billions of people in prosperity, the world must turn to sun to power our future\nSo, at Paris, India launched a International Solar Alliance to forge a partnership between solar-rich countries.\nWe need science and technology to clean energy an integral part of our existence, but also to combat the effects of climate change on our lives.\nWe are able to develop climate resilient agriculture. We must understand the impact of climate change on our weather, biodiversity, glaciers, and oceans; And, how to adjust them them We must strengthen our ability to forecast natural disasters.\nDistinguished delegates,\nWe will also address the growing challenges of rapid urbanization. This is critical for a sustainable world\nFor the first time in human history, we are in an urban century. By the middle of the century, two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities A little less than 3.0 billion people will join the existing 3.5 billion urban dwellers. And, 90% of the increase will come from developing countries.\nMany urban clusters in Asia\nMore than 50% of India will be living in urban habitats by 2050. And, by 2025, India may already have more than 10% of the global urban population.\nStudies suggest that 40% of the global urban population lives in informal settlements, or slums, where they have a range of health and poultry challenges.\nCities are the major engines of economic growth, employment opportunities and prosperity\nBut, cities account for more than two-thirds of global energy demand and the result in up to 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nThat is why I have placed so much emphasis on smart cities.\nIt is not just about cities that are becoming more efficient, safe and better in delivery of services. It is also a vision of sustainable cities that are both locomotives of our economies and havens of healthy living.\nWe will need sound policies to achieve our goals, but we will rely on science and technology to provide creative solutions.\nWe should develop better scientific tools to improve the city planning with sensitivity to local ecology and heritage; And, reduce the demand for transport, improve mobility and reduce congestion.\nMuch of our urban infrastructure We must use the local materials with scientific improvements; and, and make buildings\nWe have to find affordable and practical solutions for solid waste management; Converting waste into building materials and energy; and, recycling waste water\nUrban agriculture and ecology should get more attention And, our children should breathe cleaner city air And, we need solutions that are broad and rooted in science and innovation.\nWe need your inputs to make our cities more immune to the consequences of natural disasters and our homes more resilient. This will also mean making of retrofit\nDistinguished delegates,\nA sustainable future for this planet will depend on not only on what we do on land, but also on how we treat our oceans.\nOceans occupy more than 70% of our planet; And, over 40% of humanity and 60% of the world's largest cities are found within 100 kilometers of the coast.\nWe are at the cusp of a new era, where oceans will become important drivers of our economies Their sustainable use can bring prosperity; And, give us clean energy, new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries.\nThat is why I refer to the Small Island States as Large Ocean States.\nOcean is critical to India's future, too, with over 1300 islands, a 7500 km coastline and 2.4 million square kilometers of Exclusive Economic Zone.\nThat is why, in the past year, we have increased our focus on sea or blue economy. We will raise the level of our scientific efforts in marine science.\nWe will set up an advanced center of research in marine biology and biotechnology and establish a network of coastal and island research stations in India and abroad.\nWe have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economics with many countries. We will also hold an International Conference on \"Ocean economy and Pacific Island Countries\" in New Delhi in 2016.\nDistinguished delegates,\nRivers have played as important role in human history as oceans. Civilizations have been nurtured by rivers. And, rivers will remain critical for our future\nSo, the revival of rivers is an important part of my commitment for a cleaner and healthier future for our society, and the renewal of our heritage.\nWe need regulations, policy, investments and management to achieve our objective. But, we will only succeed when you integrate technology, engineering and innovation in our efforts, not only to our cities.\nFor this, we also need scientific understanding of the impact of urbanisation, farming, industrialization and groundwater use and contamination on the river eco-system.\nRiver is the soul of Nature Their renewal must be sustainable\nIn India, we see humanity as part of Nature, not outside or superior to it, and divinity manifested in Nature's variety forms.\nSo, conservation is rooted in the natural instincts of our culture and tradition, and in our commitment to the future\nIndia has a rich heritage of ecological knowledge. We have scientific institutions and human resources to help in the form of national action on conservation that is rooted firmly in scientific studies and methods.\nDistinguished delegates,\nAnd, if we want to restore the harmony between human and nature, we must also\nSocieties across the world\nAnd, they hold the secrets to economic, efficient, and, environmentally friendly solutions.\nBut, today they are at risk of extinction in our globalized world.\nLike traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature. So, we must recognize that science, as we see it, does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world.\nAnd, we must bridge the distance between traditional knowledge and modern science, so that we can craft local and more sustainable solutions for our challenges\nSo, in agriculture, even as we want to make our farms yield more, reduce the intensity of our water use, or increase the nutrient content of our farm output,\nWe should also integrate traditional technologies, local practices and organic farming to make our agriculture less resource intensive and more responsive.\nAnd, in the area of ​​health, modern medicine has transformed healthcare. But, we must also use scientific techniques and methods to delve deeper into traditional medicines and practices like Yoga for more holistic lifestyle and change.\nThis is especially important in dealing with growing challenges of lifestyle diseases that take a huge toll in terms of human life and economic costs.\nDistinguished delegates,\nAs a nation we still inhabit many worlds.\nWe are at the global frontiers of science and technology\nWe also see the uncertainty and despair of many people on the edge of existence, looking for a life of hope, opportunity, dignity and equity.\nWe should meet these aspirations at a speed and on a scale that is rare in human history.\nAnd, from the richness of our tradition, the consciousness of our age, we must choose the most sustainable path possible.\nThe success of one-sixth of humanity will also mean a prosperous and sustainable future.\nWe can only\nWe will realize that, in the words of Vikram Sarabhai, \"We encourage scientists to interest themselves in their fields of specialization.\"\nAnd, the influence of science will be the greatest when scientists and technologists will keep the principles of what I call Five Es at the center of their inquiry and engineering:\nEconomy - When we find cost effective and efficient solutions\nEnvironment - When our carbon footprint is the lightest and the impact on the ecology is the least possible\nEnergy - when our prosperity relies less on energy; and the energy we use keeps our sky blue and our earth green.\nEmpathy - When our efforts are in our culture, situations and social challenges\nEquity - when science advances inclusive development and improves the welfare of the weakest.\nThis year we mark a hundred years of significant moment in the history of science, when Albert Einstein published in 1916 \"The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\". Today, we must recall the humanism that defined his thought: \"Concern for man himself and his fate should always be the main interest of all technical endeavors. \"\nNothing can be a high duty for us, whether we are in public life, or we are private citizens, and whether we are in business or explore science, than our future generations for the planet in a better state.\nLet the different disciplines of science, technology and engineering\nThank you.\nGreat pleasure to start the year in the company of leaders of science, from India \u0026 world: PM at Science Congress https://t.co/ZenUvXBQL5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nWe have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in India: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/ZenUvXBQL5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nWe are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nPM @narendramodi is paying tributes to Dr. Kalam at the Indian Science Congress https://t.co/ZenUvXBQL5\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nYour theme is a fitting tribute to Dr. Kalam's vision: PM @narendramodi at the Indian Science Congress\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nOur success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space: PM @narendramodi at the Indian Science Congress\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nWe have enhanced food and health safety; And, we have given hope for a better life to others in the world: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nAs we increase the level of our ambitions for our people, we will also have the scale of our efforts: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nGood governance is about integrating science and technology in the choices we make and PM: @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nOur digital networks are expanding the quality and reaching public services and social benefits for the poor: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nI am encouraging more about scientific collaboration between Central and State institutions and agencies: PM @narendramodi at Science Congress\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nWe will make it easy to do science and research in India: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 3, 2016\nInnovation should not just be the goal of our science.
