"who do good to others,\nAs the person who distributes henna,\ngets its color free.)\nIt means that as the henna colors the hands are its distributor, similarly, those people are themselves benefited, who do good to others, who help others\nDuring this span of Bhaktikaal, many great souls like Raskhan, Surdas, Malik Mohammad Jaysi, Keshavdas, Vidyapati had emerged, who had not only shown its society, but also made efforts to reform it through their speeches and literature.\nOur saints have kept the importance of karma (action) in human life, human character, at highest of all. A great saint of Gujarat, Narsi Mehta said-\nwach-kachh-mann nishchal rakhe, par-dhan jhale haath re\nit means, a person should always keep his words, works and thoughts sacred, should not touch others. This is a very big fight against black money and corruption.\nA great social reformer, Vaseshwar, who gave the world the ideology of Anubhav Mantap or the first Parliament, said that human life can only be enlightened through selfless Karma yoga. Involvement of self interest in the first cause of corruption As much as the selfless Karma yoga is promoted, the corrupt behavior will come down in the society.\nSri Madhavacharya always stressed on the fact that no work is inferior or superior.\nWorks performed with honesty and sincerity\nHe said that paying tax is the government and serving the humanity.\nWe are proudly say that India has such a great tradition It has such great saints, great men, who used their devotion, their knowledge to change the fate of the nation, to build the nation.\nOur saints\nFrom personal to the world\nFrom self to the community\nFrom I to We\nFrom Jeev to Shiv\nFrom Jeevatma to Paramatma\nInnumerable saints like Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Jyotiba Fule, Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Pandurang Shastri Athawale, and Vinoba Bhave have always kept India's spiritual flow alive. They started people's movement against evil traditions of the society\nThey left the indelible marks on people 'awareness from ending cast feelings to people's awareness, from devotion to peoples' power, from ending to Sati Kupratha to enhancing cleanliness, social harmony to education and health from literature and brought changes there.\nThe great stalwarts like them have given such power to the country, which is unique and incomparable.\nBrothers and sisters,\nDue to such a great saint tradition of continuous efforts to end social evils, we have been able to keep our cultural heritage intact for centuries. Due to such a great saint tradition, we have been continuously realizing the concept of national unification and nation building.\nSuch saints are not limited to any particular era, but they have been influencing from era to era\nThe saints of our country have always encouraged the society that if any religion is superior to any other religion, that is human religion.\nOur country, our society is facing challenges even today Saint Community and Mutts are giving great contributions in meeting the challenges When the saint society says that the cleanliness is God, it has more impact in comparison with any Government campaign.\nThis inspires toward economic cleanliness also. If the malpractice is a challenge before the society, the modern saint community can also provide its solution.\nThe Saint community plays a very important role. In our culture, the trees have been sensitive and alive. Subsequently, a India's son and great scientist Dr. Jagdish Chandra Bose also proved it before the world.\nOtherwise, the world had no faith in it and they were used to make fun of us.\nFor us, the nature is mother, it is not for exploitation, but it is for service At our land, there was tradition to sacrifice his own life for the sake of trees, people perform prayer before a tree. We are being taught from childhood to animals and animals.\nAfter performing daily news, we're talking about peace But it is also a truth that this tradition has been adversely affected gradually with times Today, the saint community has had to continue The challenges of climate change can be tackled by adopting the solutions in our conduct, which has been mentioned in our epics and those are the parts of our traditions.\nToday also, you can observe that whenever the countries across the world find any kind of obstruction in path of the life, they will eventually see India's culture and civilization.\nIn one way, the Indian culture possesses all the problems of the world. In India, it is easily acknowledged that one God could be worshiped in various forms. It has been told in Rig-Veda-ekam satyame vadhara vadanti ... a super truth is being named in different names. We not only accept diversity, but celebrate it\nWe believe in 'Vasudhaiv kutumbakam' - whole world as one family. We say-sahnavastu-sah nu bhunaktu ... all are nourished, all are having power, no one has enmity to anyone It is the only solution to radicalism The radicalism is the root cause of terrorism, claiming its path to be just right. While in India, people of different faiths have been living in centuries, not only in the principles but in practical also. We are the people who believe in equal value for all beliefs.\nI believe that if we are living together in this age of today, if we are trying to end the evils of society, its major cause is our Saints' inspiration of enlightenment, works and devotion.\nIt is the need of today's time; During the worship we should remember our God of worship and Mother India together. I wish the saint community to continue showing the path to liberate our country from the evils, like illiteracy, unawareness, mal-nutrition, black money, corruption, which has gripped our Mother India\nI wish that all of you are going to experience the spiritualism All of you will be constantly strengthening the power of the people through the feelings of - Vayam amritasya putraha. With these words, I express my gratitude to all of you.\nThanks a lot !!!\nFrom 1968 to more than four decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh have taken charge of Udupi Municipal Corporation: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nIn 1968 Udupi was the first such municipal corporation that had banned manual scavenging: PM Modi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nThis is the characteristic of our society that whenever the evils have come, the work of reform has started in the middle of society: PM https://t.co/4QUomqKFZv\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nThis is the wonderful ability of Indian society that from time to time we will find such great men who recognized these evils and showed them the path of liberation: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nOur history is a witness that the people started their movement to improve the wrong practices that our Saints were running, adding this mass movement to devotion.\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nAdi Shankaracharya went to the four corners of the country and showed people the path of getting absorbed in God, above the worldliness: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nSaint Kabir also worked tirelessly to liberate society with caste system and rituals: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nA trendsetter of religion, philosophy and literature was established during the Bhakti movement, which still inspires everyone: PM Modi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nGujarat's great saint Narasimha Mehta used to say: Watch-Kach-Mana Nishchal Rakha, Paratha Navvahal Hai Re: PM Modi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nShri Madhavacharya has always stressed that no work is small or big, the work done with full devotion is like worshiping God\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nThey used to say that as we pay taxes to the government, just like when we serve humanity, it is like giving tax to God: PM Modi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nHindustan has been such a great saint who has used his penance, knowledge to build a nation: PM Modi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nDue to the great saint tradition of ending social evils, we have been able to save our cultural heritage for centuries: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nWhenever there is any kind of obstruction in the way of life in the countries of the world, the eyes of the world look at India's culture: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nWe celebrate the diversity we do not accept: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2017\nThe illusions like illiteracy, ignorance, malnutrition, black magic, corruption, have strained the Indian mother, to show her the way of saintly ways: PM Modi"
