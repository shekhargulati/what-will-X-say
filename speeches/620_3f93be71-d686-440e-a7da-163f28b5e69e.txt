Industry,\nLadies and Gentlemen!\nI am happy to be today\nIndia-South Africa relations are built on a strong foundation of history\nWe were directed by destiny;\nWe are driven by dreams\nOur history had many common chapters\nWith struggle and sacrifice, we changed the course of history.\nFortunately, in this process,\nwe had the guidance of the great leaders\nFriends,\nOur leaders like Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi brought political freedom for us.\nNow, it is the time for work\nThus, our relations rest on our common desires.\nWe have been friends in adversities;\nNow we should\nWith the blessings of our great leaders, both the countries have marched on the path of development.\nBoth South Africa and India are important players in the BRICS economies.\nOur people at home and the world at large expectations.\nWe can join hands on the twin expectations.\nIt is heartening that we have had very active and fruitful engagement on all possible fronts.\nThis august gathering is also an important part of the same process.\nFriends,\nI admit that I am very late in visiting this great country.\nHowever, President Zuma and I have met several times in last two years.\nSouth Africa is India's key trade and investment partner.\nIn the last ten years, bilateral trade has grown almost 380%.\nThe story of investments too\nThere is a continuous flow of investments\nMore than 150 Indian companies are operating in South Africa\nSimilarly, many companies of South Africa are doing excellent work in India.\nHowever,\nThe potential is increasing day by day.\nThis is the reason why both countries are strengthening their economic fundamentals.\nSo, we must look at ways to diversify our trade basket, to complement our needs and to serve the people.\nOur active partnership across various facets and forums is a testimony to the fact that such engagement is possible.\nFriends,\nFor Indian companies, South Africa is a home in the continent.\nMany leading Indian companies have a foot-print here.\nThey are engaged in a wide range of activities.\nMany Indian CEOs are here with us\nMy advice to them is to see that their business results in socio - economic transformation of this great country\nI have been advocating three Ps for India\n(Public Sector, Private Sector and People's Partnership).\nI have been emphasizing on the Personal Sector.\nThe same applies here.\nSkill development and community empowerment\nThe spirit of African humanism, UBUNTU, should reflect in your business ethos\nThis is equal to our philosophy of\nMay all live happily\nThis is what Mahatma Gandhi stood for.\nWe have always believed in nurturing and nourishing not in exploiting.\nEncouraging is the fact that our business engagement is not one way.\nSouth African companies are also active in India\nMany of them have been present\nWe have learned from your innovative products\nSouth African business excellence and Indian capacities should leverage each other; for growth and development in our two countries\nFriends,\nIn last two years, we have worked hard on all fronts.\nWe have got very encouraging results of our sincerity and hard work.\nToday, India is a bright star in the global economy.\nWe are being seen as the engine of global growth.\nIndia has become the fastest growing economy\nAt a time of global slowdown, we have registered 7.6% growth in GDP\nWorld Bank, IMF and other organizations have also projected\nNot only that, in 2014-15, India contributed 12.5% ​​of global growth.\nIts contribution to global growth is 68% higher than its share of the world economy.\nThe FDI in the highest ever\nThe rating agency Moody's has said that FDI inflows were all-time high in 2016, highlighting the success of our 'Make in India' initiative.\nMake in India has been the biggest brand that India has ever had\nBoth within and outside the country, it has captured the imagination of people, institutions, industries, businesses, media and the political leadership.\nAs part of the Make in India exercise, we have given emphasis on ease of doing business.\nWe have taken steps to ease the licensing processes and rationalize the provisions related to clearances, returns, and inspections.\nIf I talk about some other indicators:\nIndia has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by many global agencies and institutions.\nWe have jumped 12 ranks in the latest global ranking by the World Bank.\nIndia has also improved its UNCTAD ranking of investment attractiveness.\nAgainst 15th so far, now we are at 9th place.\nIndia has also jumped 16 places on the World\nDue to the positive impact of our policies and practices, our confidence has gone up\nThis also gives us motivation to become a simplest place to do business.\nAn innovative Start-up India program has also been launched for incubate ideas and develop them in enterprises.\nThis is a good influence on the expansion of the job market.\nThis end leads to India becoming a better quality of life and higher living standards.\nWe have ensured that our growth is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities.\nWe are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure in both core areas and social sectors.\nFriends,\nSocio-economic challenges of both our countries are more or less the same.\nMy advice is that the wheels of development should not be re-invented.\nOur two countries are very unique\nFor example:\nNature has been on both of us\nWe have immense natural resources\nThe need is to properly harness them and to use them\nWe can learn a lot from\nWe specially want to engage with your world class mining companies.\nSome of them are already active in India\nBut we want strategic engagements on this front\nOur interest in this sector is not one sided.v · Secondly, the challenge of climate change and the need for fast track development is before both of us\nWe are both committed to clean and green pathways to progress.\nAt the same time, we need energy resources\nWith the help of a number of countries, we have formed the International Solar Alliance\nI hope that we will enrich and take advantage of this forum.\nOur two countries have the unique advantage of opposite seasons\nWhen it is summer or mango season in India, it is winter here, and vice versa.\nWe could also leverage the geographic advantage to market each other's fruits, vegetables and other perishables\nIndia with its huge domestic market offers huge opportunities for your food processing industry.\nOur collaboration in this sector will bring our farmers and our villages\nWe are in India\nThe work that is suspended from the days of independence\nTogether, we can do a lot to fill these gaps.\nIndia is the best suited for technology and skills.\nEfforts are already underway in these areas.\nAt the India Africa Forum Summit held in New Delhi last year, we under-took to educate and train 50,000 Africans in India over the next five years.\nThese are just a few examples.\nWe can work together in a number of areas.\nFrom Defense to Dairy;\nFrom Medicines to Medical Tourism;\nFrom Soft Skills to Science and Technology\nThere are opportunities for us\nIndia today is among the most open economies.\nWe have liberalised our FDI regime in most areas and in all possible ways.\nWe have been rationalised our norms and made it easy for businesses to establish and grow.\nFriends,\nTo conclude, I would like to say that we have added institutional depth to our partnership\nOur BRICS business engagement and CEOs have helped our partnership\nToday, we have successfully held the 3rd meeting of the India-South Africa CEO's Forum.\nWe value your recommen- dations and look ahead in\nWe are thankful to the South African government for introducing 10 year BRICS visa for regular business travellers.\nThe Indian Industry is very encouraged by the move.\nIn February this year, we launched our e-Visa program for South Africa.\nThis is valid for short term tourists and business travellers.\nYou can now get your visa for India at your home, and that too free of cost!\nFriends,\nLet us join hands once more;\nLet us commit ourselves once again;\nThis is the enemy of poverty;\nThis is probably more challenging;\nBut we have to succeed;\nOur great leaders\n\nThank you.\nIndia-South Africa relations are built on a strong foundation
