Combating it should be major priority for G20\nI thank you for the schedule\nExcellencies, we are here to discuss this two other major global challenges- development and climate change.\nThis year is a milestone. The United Nations turned 70.We have adopted the sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations. We are going away from our planet\nExcellencies,\nThe SDGs area is a comprehensive set of goals that will eliminate poverty in the world by 2030 as its top goal. And, it creates the right balance between growth, development, human welfare and environment.\nG20 must align itself with the SDGs In doing so, we will also encourage faster and more broad-based economic growth.\nExcellencies,\nIndia's development goals are aligned with the SDGs.\nWe are promoting growth and investing in skills to create jobs for our youth; and, investing in making far more productive and resilient.\nWe have the world's largest financial inclusion program And, we have fixed target dates for our people\nThrough bold economic and governance reforms, we have achieved a growth rate of around 7.5% with strong prospects for a higher growth rate in the near future.\nGiven our size and scale, India can become a pillar of global growth and stability.\nExcellencies, We in India do not see development and climate change as competing objectives. This is centered on the belief in the unity of humanity and Nature.\nWe have been discussing the challenges of climate change.\nThis includes additional capacity of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022;\ncut in subsidies on fossil fuel and tax on coal; And, National Clean Energy Fund of US $ 3 billion to promote clean technologies\nWith our highly ambitious / intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), India will remain in the footsteps of the world.\nWe look forward to a concrete outcome in Paris within the framework of the UN Convention on Climate Change. The Framework has a proper balance of collective action: Equity and Common but differentiated responsibility and related capabilities.\nAt G 20, we can play an effective role in supporting the multilateral goals of developing renewable energy. We should also ensure that the financial and global ispiration for clean energy.\nWe should meet the target of US $ 100 billion goal per year by 2020\nG20 countries should increase the traffic on public transport in cities by 30% by 2030\nWe should shift from \"carbon credit\" to \"green credit\"\nWhen we speak of targets, we should not only use the fossil fuel but also moderate our life style.\nDevelopment in harmony with nature is the goal of my proposal to launch, along with the French President Hollande, an alliance of solar-rich countries at the time of the COP-21 meeting.\nExcellencies, let me conclude\nWe are still short in our efforts to meet our last year's commitment to raise our collective GDP by an additional 2% by 2018\nI would like to consider how G20 can build support systems that focus on countries with maximum growth potential, help address specific bottlenecks and facilitate implementation of country strategies.\nG20 must continue to focus on infrastructure, as we did in Brisbane in 2014.\nClean energy and environment change\nBridging the current gap in infrastructure\nI am happy with the focus on small holders and food losses in the G20 Action Plan on Agriculture.\nRemittances are a key source of income for households and support for the economy in developing countries. We should define a target date before 2030\nI look forward to fruitful discussions and substantive outcomes.\nThank you!"
