So, I speak in your resilience and resolve And, I salute the world for standing, in full strength, with France and Paris.\nOver the next few days, we will decide on the fate of this planet. We do so when the consequences of the industrial age powered by fossil fuel are evident, especially on the lives of the poor.\nThe prosperous still footprint And, the world's billions\nSo, the choices are not easy. But, we have awareness and technology We need now national desire and a genuine global partnership.\nDemocratic India must grow rapidly to meet the aspirations of 1.25 billion people, 300 million of whom are not access to energy\nWe are determined to do so, guided by our ancient belief that people and planet are inseparable; that human well being and Nature are indivisible\nSo, we have set ambitious targets By 2030, we will reduce emissions by 33 to 35% percent of 2005 levels, and 40 percent of our installed capacity will be from our non-fossil fuels.\nWe will achieve it by expanding renewable energy - for, example, by adding 175 gigawatts of renewable generation by 2022. We will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tons worth of carbon dioxide.\nWe are reducing dependence on fossil fuel through levies and reduction in subsidies; switching sources of fuel and, transforming cities and public transport\nWe hope advanced nations will be the target of targeted and targeted people. It is not just a question of historical responsibility They also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact.\nAnd, climate justice demands that, with the small carbon space we still have\nThis also means aggressive Mitigation Action by developed countries before 2020, including ratification of 2nd Commitment period of Kyoto Protocol, removing conditions and revisiting targets.\nThe principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities should be the bedrock of our collective enterprise all areas - Mitigation, adaptation and means for implementation. Anything else will morally wrong; and disparities\nEquity means that national commitments should be consistent with the carbon space nations occupy.\nWe also need a strong Agreement on Adaptation and Loss and Damage.\nDeveloped countries must fulfill their responsibility to make clean energy available, affordable and accessible to all in the developing world. This is in our collective interest\nSo, we look at the developed countries to mobilize 100 billion US Dollars annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in the developing countries. They must complete their commitment in a credible, transparent and meaningful manner.\nEnergy is a basic human need So, we need an ambitious technology initiative, not just market incentives. This includes intellectual property. For this, we need to scale up the Green Climate Fund that will improve the technology and intellectual property.\nWe still need conventional energy We should make it clean And, there should be no place for unitary steps that become economic barriers for others\nWe welcome stocktaking that is transparent, covers both support and commitments, and based on differentiation.\nUltimately, for success, moderating our life is essential, and possible, for a low carbon future.\nExcellencies, The presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose.\nWe will succeed if we have the wisdom and courage to craft a genuinely collective partnership that balances responsibilities and capabilities with aspirations and needs.\nI am confident that we will\nThank You\n\nPM opens statement at @ COP21 Plenary, expresses the relilience and resolve of the French pic.twitter.com/kaVaKtEaOT\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) November 30, 2015\nWe need conventional energy but we want to clean it: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 30, 2015\nOver the next few days, we will decide the fate of this planet: PM @narendramodi at # COP21 @ COP21en\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 30, 2015\nDemocratic India must grow rapidly to meet the aspirations of 1.25 billion people, 300 million of whom are without access to energy: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 30, 2015\nWe will achieve it by expanding renewable energy - for, example, by adding 175 gigawatts of renewable generation by 2022: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) November 30, 2015\nWe will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide: PM @narendramodi"
