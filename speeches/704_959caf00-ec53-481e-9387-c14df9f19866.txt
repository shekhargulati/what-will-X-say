I am sure their participation in this festival will provide a lot of promotion to Ayurveda.\nIn India, we had a great tradition of saints and hermits who evolved our own indigenous systems of healthcare, like Ayurveda, Yoga and Siddha.\nOver time, we also interacted with different civilizations and assimilated other systems of medicine as well.\nAll these systems were based on the philosophy of \"Survey Bhavantu Sukhin, Survey Santu Niramayah.\" That is: All should remain healthy\nAyurveda is commonly defined as 'Science of life' by translating 'Ayuh (r)' as life and 'Veda' as science. Sushruta defines health as:\nSamdosha, samagni, samadhatu malakriyah prasannatma, indriyas manah swath abhidayate\nThis means that health is balanced when all three doshas or bioenergy and agni or metabolic process are balanced, and excretions are in proper order. When atman or soul, the senses, manah or intellect are in harmony with internal peace, svastha or optimal health is achieved.\nCompare this with the definition of health that the World Health Organization uses: health is a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. So we see how strongly the principles of Ayurveda are aligned with the health of propagated by the WHO.\nHealth is the complete state of well being and not the absence of disease.\nToday, Ayurveda is related to its global and broad approach to health.\nThe Ayurvedic 'dincharya' or daily schedule helps to bring about peace and harmony in one's life. Ayurvedic daily life routines are meant to enhance the total health of a human being, both mental and physical.\nWhat are the great health challenges that the world is facing today? Non-communicable diseases, lifestyle related diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and cancers have become the greatest health challenges. WHO estimates that non-communicable diseases kill about 38 million people each year and nearly three quarters of NCD deaths, that is 28 million, occur in low and middle-income countries. It is in managing these that Ayurveda offers solutions\nThe long tradition of saints and hermits who created Indian systems of healthcare like Ayurveda, yoga and siddha believes in a harmonious relationship with nature.\nThese systems try to create balance and preserve health through eco-friendly practices and sustainable sourcing of medicinal herbs.\nUnfortunately, the real potential of Ayurveda is untapped because of many reasons. Most importantly because of inadequate scientific scrutiny and concerns\nIf these issues are addressed properly, I am sure Ayurveda can provide solutions to many health problems. India can be a leader in making affordable, holistic health care available to the world.\nWhat do we do, and what are we doing to address these issues?\nOur government is fully committed to promoting the Ayurveda and traditional systems of medicine. As soon as this government was formed, the Department of Ayush was upgraded to the status of a full ministry in the Government of India.\nThe National AYUSH Mission has started to promote AYUSH medical systems through cost effective AYUSH services, strengthening of educational systems, facilitating the enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani \u0026 Homoeopathy drugs and sustainable availability of raw-materials.\nFor quality control of AYUSH drugs, steps are being taken to bring regulatory amendments for effective enforcement and strengthening the regulatory framework at the Central and State levels.\nCreating a vertical structure for AYUSH drugs in Central Drug Standards Control Organization, control over misleading advertisements and extension of financial support to the National AYUSH Mission for quality control activities are important initiatives that are underway.\nTo confirm credibility of yoga experts, a scheme for Voluntary Certification of Yoga Professionals has been launched on 22nd June last year during \"International Conference on Yoga for Holistic Health\".\nOur policy regarding Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicine is already aligned with the Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 of WHO, which has been adopted in the World Health Assembly for implementation by 192 member countries of WHO.\nThe WHO strategy includes methodologies for harnessing the potential contribution of Traditional and Complementary Medicine to health, wellness and person-centered healthcare.\nIn the words of Swami Vivekananda, therefore, we will- \"Combein the BEST OF EAST WITH THAT OF THE WEST\".\nModern systems of medicine have strong and effective diagnostic tools that allow us to screen and detect disease early. The use of technology in healthcare has the ability to reduce the barriers to accessing care, and improve our understanding of disease patterns\nHowever, we need to look beyond We need to look beyond providing healthcare and engage in the pursuit of good health, a combination of physical and mental well being.\nThe escalating costs of treatment, the side effects of medicines have prompted medical experts to think of widening their horizons to traditional systems of medicine.\nWe are committed to promote the use of traditional medicine in our Public Health System through Regulation of research and appropriate integration of quality products, practices, and practitioners in the health system.\nOur efforts are the real potential of Ayurveda and other Ayush systems in preventing, promotive and holistic healthcare to the people.\nWe will maximize the use of Ayurveda and Yoga and other traditions of healing in accordance with their genius and acumen and help promotion of integrative medical facilities. Young entrepreneurs who are planning a start-up could get a lot of opportunities in holistic healthcare.\nIn the context of health sector planning, while we think of the utility and contemporary relevance of Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems, it is also important to ponder over the realities and the challenges faced by these systems.\nTraditional Medicine It is locally available to the communities, time-tested for its safety and efficacy. Above all, it imbibes the culture and eco-system of the communities within which it grows.\nIn many parts of developing countries, traditional medical practices are the only resources of healthcare within the poor people.\nIt is therefore more important that we ensure the quality of these systems\nAll stakeholders of Ayurveda gathered here must agree that it is important for us to address the issues of safety, efficacy, quality, access and rational use of our traditional medical knowledge of Ayurveda. We should also move closely with the emerging trends in the areas of bio-medicine, health technology and information technology.\nI know that there are great efforts in China to develop and establish policies and regulations for promoting the safe use of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which comprises of a large chunk of the international trade of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\nWe will learn from the experience of other countries, and ensure that Ayurveda and other Indian systems are propagated and popularized.\nI am also told that the Delhi Declaration on Traditional Medicine adopted by South East Asian Countries in February 2013 and later resolved by the WHO Regional Committee seeks member countries to follow harmonized approaches for the developmental activities of Traditional Medicine.\nI hope, proper implementation of articles of the Delhi Declaration will help to achieve a systematic development of traditional medicine including Ayurveda as well as national, regional and global level.\nWe would like to offer our organizations as referral centers for training, capacity building and information and technology exchange programs in Ayurveda and other AYUSH systems.\nOur leadership on these fronts can become sustainable only with concerted efforts for rendering quality healthcare and education and by competent professionals.\nLadies and Gentlemen, as you are well aware, India has a long history and rich heritage of Ayurveda and Yoga. The multi-cultural origins of Ayurvedic knowledge are revealed in the classical texts themselves. Both Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita urge physicians to seek help of cowherds, hunters and forest dwellers for procuring medicinal plants.\nIn the Charaka Samhita, We notice the participation and contribution of a Central Asian physician in one of the assemblies of scholars in the formulate the principles of Ayurveda.\nThe three major classical texts give importance to Buddhist moral values. Vagbhata, who was said to be the author of one of the classical texts Ashtangahridayam, was a Buddhist.\nIt is evident, therefore, that the traditions grew by sharing knowledge, both locally as well as across cultures. They learn from the most humble as well as those with arcane knowledge\nWe will continue this effort We will share the knowledge of our systems with the world, and continue to enrich our traditions.\nThe Global Ayurveda Festival takes this vision forward.\nI wish the Vision Conclave as well as Global Ayurveda Festival a grand success. I trust that the deliberations will focus on the crucial issues of the global positioning of Ayurveda.\nI will end with words from Ashtangahridayam, one of the most famous texts of Ayurveda.\nThe poor, those suffering from disease and those afflicted Even the insects and ants should be treated with compassion\nThis is the guiding spirit of Ayurveda Let this be the guiding spirit for all of us\nThank You"
