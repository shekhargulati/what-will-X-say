"\nConfident that Winter Session will be productive: PM\nHope to get the constructive debates and innovative solutions to address the nation's problems: PM\nGood Morning Friends,\nUsually the season of winter also starts with Diwali. However, this is the impact of global warming and climate change that does not affect the intense cold these days.\nHowever, our Winter Session is getting started. And I believe that in the Winter Session, that is beginning in 2017 and will continue in 2018, many important issues of the government, that has far reaching effect, will be brought before the Parliament\nThere should be a good debate, there should be a positive debate, and the debate should take place with innovative suggestions ... only then the time of the parliament will be properly utilized for the benefit of the country.\nI am confident of it, and even yesterday we had an 'all party meeting' in which there was a common voice that the session should be used in the right way.\nAnd I also hope that if the house will function in a positive way then the country will be benefitted, democracy will be strengthened and a new trust for fulfilling the expectations and hopes of common people. Thank you very much\nThe Winter Session of Parliament is starting and I am confident that it will be productive session.
