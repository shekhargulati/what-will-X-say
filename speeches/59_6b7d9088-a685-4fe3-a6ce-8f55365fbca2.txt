"All the distinguished guests visiting India from Norway,\nFriends,\nLast year when I met Prime Minister Solberg in Stockholm, I invited him to visit and I am happy that today I got the opportunity to welcome her in India.\nThis is the first visit of Prime Minister of Norway to India and this is also special because today she will address the inaugural session of Raisina Dialogue. For this I offer my heartfelt gratitude to her\nFriends,\nWhen I met Prime Minister Solberg in 2017 in connection with the G20 Summit then she had gifted a football to me Please note that last year's Golden ball was awarded to Norway's Ada Hegerberg and for this I heartily congratulate Norway.\nBut the football that was gifted to me was Prime Minister That football did not represent the goal of soccer game, it actually represented the goals of Sustainable Development\nPrime Minister Solberg has given much encouragement to global efforts toward achieving sustainable development goals\nIn this visit, Prime Minister Solberg has also inaugurated Norway's new Green Embassy in India. And so if we talk about his global efforts\nSustainable Development Goals are also totally in congruence with the development goals of India. \"Norway-India Partnership Initiative.\" Through the mother and child health of the topic on the success of our country.\nFriends,\nTrade and investment are important. Norway's Government Pension Fund Global has made a portfolio investment of about $ 12 billion in India. I am glad that the representatives of more than 100 companies from Norway have come to India.\nThey also had a useful interaction with India's business leaders during yesterday's India-Norway Business Summit. I am confident that in the coming years, Norway's companies will benefit from India's immense potential both in Portfolio Investment and Foreign Direct Investment In particular, there are many opportunities coming up for Norwegian companies in ship-building, ports and port-led development under the 'Sagarmala Program.'\nFriends,\nOcean Economy is a subject which is also related to this. This sector is extremely important for India's development and prosperity. About 15% of India's population lives in coastal districts In a way their life is directly related to the Ocean Economy. And if we look at it on the indirectly then the population of India's coastal states is more than 500 million. And you can imagine Norway's expertise on the Ocean Economy from the fact that 70% of Norway's export is from Norway's maritime industry. And therefore, I am happy that in this important sector today we have a new dimension of cooperation in our relations. Our bilateral Ocean Dialogue will give direction to our cooperation in all areas related to this area\nFriends,\nIndia and Norway have very strong cooperation on the international forums too. There are many topics like the UN Security Council Reforms, Multi-Lateral Export Control Regimes, and Terrorism, on which we both work with very close cooperation and coordination. Today we reviewed all the areas of our cooperation, and discussed in detail ways and means to give them directions and energize them.\nExcellency,\nYou accepted my invitation to visit India, for that, I was once again expressing my heart. We are very excited to hear your address in Raisina Dialogue this evening. I hope that your visit to India will be very pleasant and successful.\nThank you.\nLast year in Stockholm when I met Prime Minister Sollberg,\nSo I had invited him to come to India.\nI am glad that today I had the opportunity to welcome him in India.\nPrime Minister's first visit to India is: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nWhen I met Prime Minister Sollberg during the G-20 Summit in 2017, he gave me a football gift.\nHowever, last year, the world's most famous \"Golden Ball\" award for the year has been awarded to Norwegian female football player Ada Hegherberg: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nThe football which I had given to the Prime Minister gave me something else.\nIt was not a football game goal, but a symbol of Sustainable Development Goals: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nPrime Minister Salberg has encouraged global efforts towards achieving sustainable development goals: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nSustainable Development Goals also keep in mind the development goals of India.\nAnd it is a matter of happiness for us that both the countries are collaborating with the \"Norway-India Partner-Ship Initiative\" on the topic of maternal and child health: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nImportance of trade and investment in India and Norway's relations is important: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nPM @erna_solberg and PM @narendramodi had had fruitful discussions related to aspects of the Ocean economy.\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 8, 2019\nIndia and Norway have very strong cooperation on the international forum too.\nU.
