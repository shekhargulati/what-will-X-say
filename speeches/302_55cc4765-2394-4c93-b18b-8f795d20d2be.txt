This budget strengthens the foundation stone of New India. The budget focus is on issues On one hand, budget covers aspects such as health plans to address the concerns of the poor and middle class, while on the other hand it is the small entrepreneurs in the country. Other aspects range from food processing to fiber optics, from road to shipping, concerns of youth and the senior citizens, from rural India to Ayushman India and Digital India to Start up India.\nThis budget is expected to give a boost to the hopes and expectations of 125 crore people of the country. It is expected to accelerate the development process It is a farmer friendly, common man friendly, business friendly friendly. Ease of Doing Business as well as in the budget More savings for the middle class, new generation infrastructure for 21st Century India and better health assurance.\nOur farmers have contributed in a big way towards the progress of the country. Several steps have been proposed in this budget to give a boost to the farmers and enhancing their income. A record allocation of Rs. 14.5 lakh crores has been made for rural development and agriculture. Dalits, oppressed and disadvantaged sections of the society will be benefited with 51 lakh new homes, more than 3 lakh kilometers of roads, about 2 crore toilets, electricity connections in 1.75 crore households. These initiatives will create new opportunities I appreciate the decision to provide one and a half times the cost to the farmers. The Center will put in a sound system in consultation with the states to ensure that the farmers can avail full benefits from this decision. 'Operation Greens' will prove to be an effective instrument in this direction. We have seen how Amul was instrumental in ensuring the fair price to the farmers in the dairy sector. We are also interested in the development of the country in our country. Now, keeping in mind the agricultural produce in different districts, agricultural cluster approach will be adopted in different districts across the country. I welcome the plan for the storage, processing and marketing facilities for a particular agricultural produce after identifying the districts.\nIn our country, the cooperative societies are exempted from paying income tax. But the 'Farmer Producer Organization' -FPO, is the same as the cooperative society, does not get this benefit. Therefore, income tax exemption for the 'Farmer Producer Organization' -FPO, which is the welfare of the farmers, is a welcome step. By providing the links to the Self Help Groups for women engaged in organic, aromatic and herbal cultivation and the 'Farmer Producer Organizations' the income of the farmers increased. Similarly, the Gobar-Dhan Yojana will help in keeping the village clean, while increasing the income of farmers and cattle herders. In our country, farmers take up different occupations Some are associated with pisciculture, animal husbandry, poultry or bee-keeping. Farmers have faced difficulty in accessing loans from banks. Arranging loan for pisciculture and animal husbandry by Kisan Credit Card is a very effective step. There are about 7000 blocks in more than 700 districts of India. In these blocks, the emphasis has been laid on modernization of infrastructure of 22 thousand rural business centers, on innovation and growing connectivity in the villages. In the days to come, these centers will be able to increase the income of farmers, creates employment opportunities and will become new hubs of agro based rural and agricultural economy. Under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojna, now the villages will be connected to rural haats (markets), higher education centers and hospitals. This will make life easier for people\nWe have seen an extension of the spirit of the Easy Living in Ujjwala Yojana. The scheme has not only provided a relief to the poor women from the smoke but also for their empowerment. I am happy to note that the target for Ujjala has been enhanced from 5 crore families to 6 crore families. A large number of Dalit, tribal and backward class families have been benefited from this scheme. This budget provides for about Rs 1 lakh crore for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\nMedical treatment and its cost has always been a cause for concern and poor sections of the society. The new scheme 'Ayushman Bharat', presented in the budget, will address this serious concern This scheme will be available to almost 10 million It means it will provide coverage to 45-50 crore people Under the scheme, these families will get free treatment up to Rs. 5 lakhs per year in the identified hospitals. This is by far, the world's largest health insurance plan. The idea of ​​setting up 1.5lakh Health Wellness Centers spread over all major panchayats of the country is commendable. This will provide easy access to health care services. Establishment of 24 new medical colleges across the country will not only facilitate the treatment of the people but also help to impart medical education to the youngsters. It is our endeavor to have a medical college for covering three parliamentary constituencies across the country.\nSeveral important decisions have been taken in the budget keeping in the concerns of the Senior Citizens. Now the Senior Citizens will be entitled to have minimum interest of 8% on the amount up to Rs 15 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandan Yojana. No tax will be levied on interest up to Rs 50,000 on their Banks and Post Office deposits Health insurance premium worth Rs 50,000 will be exempt from the Income Tax Besides, relief from the Income Tax has been provided on expenditure up to Rs 1 lakh.\nFor a long time, the small and medium enterprises or the MSME in our country had to pay higher taxes than the big industries. In a bold in this budget, the government has reduced the tax rate for MSME by 5% now they have to pay 25% tax in place of 30% which was the practice earlier. Credit seeking facility from the banks and NBFCs have been eased to ensure the working working capital for MSME industries. It will give a boost to the mission of Make in India\nMSME sector has experienced stress due to NPA in big industries The small entrepreneurs should not suffer Therefore, the government will soon announce corrective measures to solve the problems related to NPA and Stressed Account in the MSME sector.\nIn order to promote the employment and to provide social security to the employees, the government has taken a far reaching decision. This will give impetus to the shift from the informal to formal sector and it will generate new jobs opportunities. Now the government will contribute 12% in the EPF Account of the new laborers for a period of 3 years. Besides, the contribution of new women employees in the EPF for a period of 3 years is reduced from the existing 12% to 8%, so that women for their take home salary increases and more employment opportunities are available. However, the employer contribution will be maintained at 12%. This is a major step toward empowerment of working women.\nIn order to realize the dream modern India, to enhance the ease of living of the common man and to ensure sustainability in development, India needs a Next Generation Infrastructure. Special emphasis has been given to digital India. Allocation of Rs. 6 lakh crores has been made which is Rs. 1 lakh crore more than the previous year This scheme will increase the employment opportunity manifold in country\nI congratulate the finance minister for the tax dispensation to the salaried and the middle class.\nThis budget will be the expectation of every Indian Citizen. The budget has ensured the following - remunerative price of the crop to the farmer, upliftment of the poor with the welfare schemes, respecting the honesty of the tax paying citizen, to support the spirit of entrepreneurs with a right tax structure and the contribution of the hailing senior citizens for the country\nOnce again my heartfelt congratulation to the Finance Minister and his team for presenting a budget which enhances the ease of living and laying a strong foundation for the New India. \"\nThis budget has devoted attention to all sectors, ranging from agricultural to infrastructure: PM @narendramodi speaks on #NewIndiaBudget https://t.co/AyZymaQvhL\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 1, 2018\nThis budget is a friendly, common citizen friendly, business environment friendly and development friendly.
