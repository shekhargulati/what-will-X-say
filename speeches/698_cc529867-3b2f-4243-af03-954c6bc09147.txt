I welcome all of you to India, a country known for its culture of Guest Devo: and to this beautiful city of Guwahati known for its hospitality and love for sports.\nWhat moves me today, is your electrifying presence, full of excitement and enthusiasm for this important international sports event on the mighty Brahmaputra.\nGuwahati has come as a long way since the days of Pragjyotishpur in Ancient India. It is now a modern and vibrant city and a hub of all economic activities in the North-Eastern Region of India.\nYoung people in the north-east and especially here in Assam do not miss any chance to witness a good football match. This fame has spread so far and wide that the FIFA World Cup under-17 which will be hosted first time in India in 2017 has selected as a prime venue for the event.\nThis sports meet, for me signifies a perfect blend of 3 Ts - Talent, Teamwork and Togetherness Among us is the best and most youthful talent from across South Asia. You are proud of your team - it can be your team of the sport you play and a large team of the nation you are representing. And, at the same time this meet also celebrates togetherness of all South Asian countries. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - no matter which country we are from, we all call South Asia our home.\nWhat is the need for a person's life? A good game is both healthy and refreshing All Round Most importantly, sports brings with the most vital sportsman spirit. Without sports This player will not only help you in the field but also You will cherish your entire life I always say - Jo Khele, woh Khile. The person who plays, shines\nThe mascot of these games 'TIKHOR' represents a baby rhino who is sharp and intelligent. It captures the spirit of sports persons and young sport lovers.\nThe theme song of the games is \"Ei prithivi ekhan krirangan, krira hol shantir prangan\" sung by legendary late Dr. Bhupen Hazarika\nA singer whose captivating voice left people spellbound; his song beautifully captures the spirit of South Asian Games, the spirit of peace, friendship and prosperity.\nI have been told by Mr. Sarbananda Sonowalji that the SAARC nations in the eight of the SAARC countries of the Organizing Committee for the waters have come from the waters and these waters share the shared ambitions and cooperative spirit.\nDr. Bhupen Hazarika's song \"We are in the same boat brother\" which you are going to hear soon is all about SAARC nations We should join hands Let us kindle this spirit of friendship through sports in South Asian Games.\nMy vision for South Asia is the same as my vision for India - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. All South Asian countries are our partners.\nWe are living in SAARC countries, 21 percent of the world's population and contributed about 9 percent to its economy.\nAs we gather today to start the 12th South Asian Games, for 23 sporting events covering both men and women, we bring sports-persons from all SAARC countries to India's North-East and to this great city, friendship, trust and understanding of spirit .\nI am sure that as the games progress, this feeling of friendship trust and understanding will transform itself not only in sports opportunities but also in business and tourism opportunities as well.\nLet the Games become a spring board for bringing peace and prosperity in the region through business, interaction and sporting activities. Let this be a chance for SAARC people to realize their potential.\nSportsmanship is a philosophy of life The challenge for performance, the joy of effort, the cheer of success, the spirit of friendship and fairplay in a sports arena, talk volumes about how culture, education, ethics, dignity and society get intertwined with each other during such sports events.\nOn the field of sports, we can forget what separates us, and we can deal with them in the spirit of sportsmanship and adventure.\nWe will celebrate our diversity, and at the same time, be united under common rules for our sports, and honesty and fair play of shared values.\nLet us play for prosperity Let us play with full vigor and enthusiasm so that we remember\nThe friendships you will form over these 12 days, and the memories you take will last you a lifetime.\nI am confident that you will cherish these bonds, and become ambassadors for peace and friendship between our nations\nWhile people play for medals and provide tough competition to each other, I urge the sports-persons and visitors here to take time from their busy schedules to visit the places of tourist attraction and wonderful wildlife sanctuaries nearby.\nOnce again I welcome our friends from SAARC countries. Let the spirit of 'Gurukul' prevail for two weeks in Guwahati as sportspersons share their best and take back great feeling of warmth and remarkable experience.\nLet the competition be in true sports May the best win\nI declare the 12th South Asian Games open\nThank you.\nYoung people of the north east do not miss any chance to witness a good football match: PM @narendramodi in Assam\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2016\nThis sports meet is perfect blend of 3- Teamwork, togetherness and talent: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2016\nThis meeting celebrates togetherness of all South Asian Nations: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) February 5, 2016\nWhat is the need for a person's life?
