"Qiu Yong, President of Tsinghua University\nForeign Minister Wang Yi\nShi Yigong, Assistant President of Tsinghua University\nI am truly happy to be at Tsinghua University today.\nYou are a world class institution You are a symbol of success\nYou are the foundation for China's economic miracle You have produced great leaders, including President Xi.\nIt is not surprising that China's economic growth and its new leadership in research, science and technology have taken place together.\nIf you think in terms of a year, plant a seed; if you think of ten years, plant trees; If you think in terms of 100 years, teach the people\nIn India, too, the ancient saying is vyayate kart vardhate eva nityam, vidya dhanam sarva pranhanam\nThe wealth that increases by giving, that wealth is knowledge\nThis is a example of how our two nations are united in their timeless wisdom\nThere is much more, though, that links our two ancient civilizations.\nI started my journey in China. In doing so, I retraced the footsteps of the Chinese monk Xuanzang.\nHe travelled to India from Xian in the seventh century in search of knowledge and returned to Xian as a friend and chronicler of India.\nPresident Xi's visit in India It is not far from Vadnagar, my birthplace, but important, because it hosted Xuanzang and many pilgrims from China.\nThe world's first large scale educational exchange program took place between India and China during the Tang Dynasty.\nRecords talk about about 80 Indian monks coming to China and about 150 Chinese monks returning after their education in India. And yes, this was the 10th and 11th century.\nMumbai's rise as a port and a shipbuilding center is because of cotton trade with China.\nAnd, those who love the silk and textiles know that India's famous tanchoi sarees owe own to three brothers from my state of Gujarat who learn the art of weaving from Chinese masters in the 19th century.\nAnd, in a unquestionable evidence of our ancient trade, silk in our classical Sanskrit language is called Cinapatta.\nSo, the culture of culture, learning, art and trade\nIt is a picture of respect for each other's civilization and of shared prosperity.\nIt is reflected in the human values ​​of Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, a doctor from India, who treated soldiers in China during the Second World War.\nToday, after hard and sometimes dark passages of history, India and China stand at a rare moment of vast and multi transitions in the world.\nPerhaps, the most significant change of this era is the re-emergence of China and India.\nThe world's two most populous nations are undergoing economic and social transformation on a scale and at a speed that is unmatched in history.\nChina's success over the past three decades\nIndia is the next frontier of the economic revolution.\nWe have the demography for it About 800 million people in India are below the age of 35 years. Their aspirations, energy, enterprise and skills will be the force for India's economic transformation.\nWe now have the political mandate and will do it happen.\nOver the past year, we have moved with a clear and coherent vision. And, we have acted with speed, resolve and boldness to implement it.\nWe have taken sweeping steps to reform our policies and open foreign direct investments. This includes new areas like insurance, construction, defense and railways.\nWe are eliminating unnecessary regulations and simplifying our procedures. We are using digital technologies and endless wait.\nWe are building a tax regime that is predictable, stable and competitive, and that will integrate the Indian market.\nInfrastructure - roads, ports, railways, airports, telecom, digital networks and clean energy.\nOur resources are being allocated with speed and transparency. And, we will make sure that land acquisition does not become a barrier to growers or farmers.\nWe are making the global skill pool for a modern economy with a world class manufacturing sector.\nWe are reworking our agriculture sector to our farmers and boost our growth.\nLike China, the urban renewal is both an essential and a means to add energy to our economy.\nWe are developing traditional strategies with modern economic instruments to eliminate poverty.\nWe have launched major schemes on financial inclusion of all, providing funds to the un-banked, and ensuring efficient and direct transfer of benefits to the poor. And, we ensure that insurance and pension schemes are the poorest to reach.\nWe have set time bound goals for providing access to housing, water and sanitation for all.\nThis will not just transform lives, but also a new source of economic momentum.\nAbove all, we are changing the way we are not just in the way we work in New Delhi, but also in the way we work together with state governments, districts and cities.\nBecause we know, as you do, that is our vision may be formed in Delhi, but our success will be determined by state capitals\nThat is why I am here today with two Chief Ministers, which is a new aspect of our foreign policy. And, for the first time for India, Premier Li and I will sit with provincial leaders and chief ministers to discuss our partnership.\nI know that rewriting policies can be easier than changing mindsets and work culture. But, we are on the right path\nYou will feel the change in India And, you can see it in our growth rate It has now increased to 7.5%, and we are encouraged by international experts.\nIn many ways, our two countries reflect the same aspirations, similar challenges and the same opportunities.\nWe can be inspired by each other's successes.\nAnd, in the global uncertainties of our times, we can reinforce each other's progress.\nPerhaps, no other economy in the world offers such opportunities for the future as India's. And, some partnerships\nDuring President Xi's visit last September, we set up a new level of ambition for our cooperation.\nPartnership in modernizing Indian railways, two Chinese industrial parks in India, commitments of 20 billion dollars in investments in India over the next five years partnership in our Make in India Mission: This is the shape of our future.\nTomorrow in Shanghai, we will see the agreements on those partnerships between our industries.\nBut, to maintain this partnership over the long run, we must also improve the reach of the Chinese market. I am encouraged by President Xi's and Premier Li's commitment to resolve this problem\nAs much as our bilateral cooperation, our international partnership will be important.\nOur changing world has created new opportunities and challenges\nWe both face instability in our shared neighborhood that can be used to threaten our security and slow down our economies.\nThe spreading tide of extremism and terrorism is a threat to both faces; for both, its source is the same region\nWe must also deal with the changing character of terrorism that has made it less predictable and more diffuse.\nWe have a very strong presence in the region.\nIndia and China conduct their own international commerce on the same sea lanes. The security of sea lanes is vital for our two economies; And, our cooperation is essential to achieve it.\nEqually, we both seek to connect a fragmented Asia There are projects that we will pursue individually There are few such as the Bangladesh, China India Myanmar Corridor that are doing doing jointly.\nBut, geography and history tell us that the dream of an interconnected Asia will be successful, when India and China work together.\nWe are two countries that have gained a lot from an open, rule-based global trading system. Equally, we have got to lose\nWe both have enormous stakes in the international negotiations. Our cooperation in these forums will be crucial.\nToday, we speak of Asia's resurgence It is the same time\nIt is an Asia of great promise, but also many uncertainties.\nAsia's re-emergence is leading to a multi-polar world that we both welcome\nBut, it is also an unpredictable and complex environment.\nWe can be more certain of a peaceful and stable future for Asia if India and China cooperate closely\nA resurgent Asia is seeking a bigger voice in global affairs. India and China seek a great role in the world. It may be reforms in the United Nations Security Council or the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nBut, Asia's voice will be strong and our nation's role is more influential, if India and China speak in one voice - for all of us and for each other\nSimply put, the prospects of the 21st century becoming the Asian century will depend on large measure on what India and China achieve individual and what we do together.\nThe rising fortunes of 2.5 billion pairs of join hands will be the greatest consequence for our region and the humanity.\nThis is the vision that I share with President Xi and Premier Li.\nThis is the impulse that is driving our relationship\nIn recent years, we have deepened our political engagement. We have kept our borders peaceful We have been able to impede closer cooperation. We have enhanced our cooperation.\nYet, if we have the ability to express our partnership, we must also address the issues that lead to hesitation and doubts, even distrust, in our relationship\nFirst, we must try\nWe both recognize that this is history's legacy. Resolving it is our shared responsibility to the future. We must move ahead with new purpose and determination.\nThe solution we want to do more than settlement\nIt should do so in a way that transforms our relationship and not new breakdowns.\nWe have been successful in maintaining peace and tranquility along the border.\nWe must continue to do the principle of mutual and equal security.\nOur agreements, protocols and border mechanisms have been helpful.\nBut, a shadow of uncertainty always hangs over\nIt is the only reason why the Line of Actual Control is, in these areas.\nThat is why I have been resuming the process of clarifying it. We can do this for our situation on the boundary question.\nWe should think of creative solutions to issues that have become irritants - from visa policies to trans-border rivers.\nSometimes, small steps can have a deep impact on how our people see each other\nWe are both growing our involvement in our shared neighborhood. This calls for deep strategic communication to build mutual trust and confidence.\nWe must ensure that our relationships are not included in other countries. And, wherever possible and feasible, we should work together, as we respond in the earthquake in Nepal.\nIf the last century was the age of alliances, this is an era of inter-dependence. So, talks of alliances against one another\nIn any case, we are both ancient civilizations, large and independent nations Neither of us\nSo, our partnership in international forums should not be determined by the concerns of others.\nChina's support for India's permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council, and for India's export control regimes like Nuclear Suppliers Group has just strengthened our international cooperation.\nIt will take our relationship to a new level.\nIt will give Asia a strong voice in the world\nIf we are able to deepen mutual trust and confidence, we will also be able to reinforce each other's efforts of connecting Asia and rest of the world.\nOur soldiers face each other on the border, but we should also deepen our defense and security cooperation.\nAbove all, as we look forward, we will build more bridges\nAbout 33% of the world's population is either Indian or Chinese. Yet, our people know very little of each other\nWe must seek inspiration from the pilgrims of the ancient times, who braved the unknown in search of knowledge, and enriched us both.\nSo, we have decided to extend electronic tourist visas to Chinese nationals. We are celebrating the \"Year of India\" in China in 2015. We are launching the 'Provincial and State Leaders Forum' today.\nLater today, we have the Yoga-Taichi event. It will represent the future of our two civilizations.\nWe are starting the Gandhi and India Study Center in Fudan University and a college of Yoga in Kunming.\nThe second route to Kailash Mansarovar for Indian pilgrims will start in June, for which I want to thank President Xi.\nThese are just some of the many steps India and China are taking to bring the world's two largest population in close contact.\nFor this reason, I decided to speak today at a university.\nBecause it is the youth that will inherit the future of our relations\nPresident Xi has spoken eloquently about the inter-connected dreams of China and India and the new type of relationship between major countries.\nNot only are our dreams inter-connected, our future is also deeply inter-connected\nWe are at a moment, when we have the opportunity to make our choices\nIndia and China are two proud civilizations and two great nations that will fulfill their destinies.\nSuccess in our own paths\nBut, we have the ancient wisdom to know that our journey will be smoother and our future bright, when we walk together, confident of one another, and in step with each other\nThank you very much and thanks for your invitation\n\nText of Prime Minister's replies during Question-answer session at Tsinghua University, Beijing\nPrime Minister's response to the questions asked in the context of the Indo-China Bilateral relations to a Regional Social Forum.\nPrime Minister-I have covered this issue Now the world order has changed completely and the global community has conceded that the 21st century belongs to Asia It increases the responsibilities of Asia and China. The two countries will have to take initiatives for economic development. China specializes in three aspects - Scale, Skill and speed They undertake enormous tasks and that too at a great speed.\nIndia too There are many sectors where we can make join hands Three decades ago, China saw a chance in urbanization. The focus was on Urban Infrastructure, Urban Polity of life, 'Urban areas' as growth centers for the economy, and China came along with good results as well. India is moving ahead with the idea of ​​smart cities. I think it is necessary that both the nations have collaborated, like we could achieve a lot together in IT sector. Tourism There is a great deal of exchange in the technology sector. That is why I have been elaborated in my speech\nPrime Minister's response to the questions asked in reference to Indian economy in Democracy, population dividend and market demands.\nPrime Minister: Thank you. I always say that democracy, demography and a nation of 125 crores is a huge purchasing power in itself. At the same time a nation with 800 million people below 35 years of age and a system in which the world has natural faith is democracy, it has made it easier for our people to connect with the world. Democracy has such power that in the days to come it will attract world attention.\nWe want to venture into manufacturing sector The whole world has workforce requirement There are many such countries which need workforce beyond 2020 .There are many countries who have technology, infrastructure but no workforce At that time, India will be able to cater to the workforce requirement. We have the potential\nSimilarly, youth power plays a major role in manufacturing sector Youth play an important role in Research and Innovation. The current demographic dividend that India has, is not just a power for India, but it is also an important means to meet the needs of the world. So we are emphasizing on skill development of Indian youth. Our goal is to help the endeavors of our efforts. And of course the People's Republic of the world, today has faith in democracy. So India has a natural advantage here"
