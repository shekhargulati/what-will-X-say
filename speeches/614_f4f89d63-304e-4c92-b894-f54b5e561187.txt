Your leadership is an example for the whole region.\nIn this fight against terrorism, you do not understand yourself alone. India's full support is with you.\nI also assure Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that in your fight from terrorism India is ready for your every possible help.\nExcellency,\nWe are on a twist today, where not only our challenges are equal but also the paths of our development.\nI have always believed that the development of India is associated with the development of all our neighboring countries.\nBoth India and Bangladesh are not only on the path of development. Rather we are walking together in this journey.\nThat is why today this event is a very important milestone for the Petrapole-Benapole dedicated to the masses of both countries.\nIt is not only important for the development of bilateral trade but also an important gateway to the economic prosperity of the two countries.\nIts significance is evident from one thing that today 50% of the total trade between the two countries goes through Petrapole-Benapole. In 2015-16 more than 15 thousand crores of trade has passed through Petrapole-Benapole.\nEvery year about 1.5 million people and 1.5 million trucks pass through here.\nThis is the largest land port in South Asia.\nEarlier, Petrapole had only 15 acres of land customs station, in which limited facilities were available.\nI am happy that in the area of ​​100 acres at the cost of about 142 crores, this Integrated Check Post has been prepared, which will facilitate security, immigration, customs, etc. for integrated passengers, cargo and transport.\nBefore that we have completed the work of Integrated Check Post in Agartala.
