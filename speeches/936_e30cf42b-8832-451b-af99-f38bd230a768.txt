Yet, they blend easily into a way of life that has been formed by the world of different parts from the winds and waves.\nThis morning I went to Ganga Talao. I feel a personal connection that comes from the Ganga in my parliamentary constituency - Benaras.\nAnd, I got the powerful links of heart that has endured the time and distance in this magnificent land.\nToday, these links form the firmest foundation of our relationship They have made goodwill and warmth rarely seen in international relations. They have built an unbreakable chain of trust between us.\nToday we are equally proud to have a relationship. We can also relate to our shared democratic values. We are partners in our economic progress. We shoulder our shared responsibility to advance security in the Indian Ocean.

We have acted with speed, resolve, innovation and boldness to increase economic growth; reform our economy and change the lives of our people; and create opportunities for the most excluded youth, the remotest farmer and the farthest village.\nI am confident that under Prime Minister Jugnauth, development in Mauritius will become more impressive.\nAnd, I can assure you that as soon as you - in support of your success\nYesterday, I told Prime Minister Jugnauth that we understand the importance of the offshore banking sector for your economy.

We are seeking to develop our marine economy and discover new possibilities. We are doing this in a sustainable manner that preserves the delicate ecosystem of our oceans. Indeed, the oceans hold vast potential to advance our prosperity and meet the challenges of the world.\nThat is why I consider the blue chakr in our national flag as a symbol of Blue Revolution; just as saffron represents energy revolution, white the milk revolution and, green the energy revolution.\nThis offers a great opportunity for cooperation between our two countries. We can learn from you. Together, we can better understand our marine ecology and the new opportunities. We can improve our ability to pursue more sustainable practices.\nOur partnership should also be For India, it is a mission that we are pursuing on a completely new scale and with a new sense of urgency. We have set an ambitious target of 100 Gigawatts of solar energy and 60 Gigawatts of wind energy by 2022. We will try to dramatically increase our energy efficiency, which is the cleanest form of energy.\nThis is a choice that is driven by the future, but also by principles\nAnd for me, it is an Article of Faith.\nWe are the inheritors of an ancient tradition and wisdom that elevated preservation of nature to a sacred duty; that worships Earth as a mother; And, that treats reckless exploitation of nature as a crime\nMauritius has been a leading international voice on climate change, not just a lawyer for island states, but for the sake of our collective future.

This resolution was passed by a record time frame.\nThis is a tribute to our shared heritage I know you will celebrate it with fervor in Mauritius.\nMadam Speaker,\nIn the life of a nation, there is nothing more valuable and satisfying than a true friend and well-wisher; nothing more comforting than his embrace; nothing more valuable than his trust; nothing more reassuring than his support; nothing more enriching than his partnership\nSo, we are blessed to have your friendship And, I always say that if there is one country that has full claims on us, it is Mauritius.\nIt is a relationship of our hearts and sentiments.
