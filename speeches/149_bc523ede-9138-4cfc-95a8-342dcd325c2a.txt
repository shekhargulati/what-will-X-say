The 7 C's are Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-Free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge\nFollowing is the full text of PM's address:\n\"Excellencies,\nDistinguished Delegates from across the World,\nLadies and Gentlemen\nI welcome you all to the Global Mobility Summit\nMove - The name of this summit captures the spirit of India today. Indeed, India is on the Move:\nOur economy is on the Move We are the world's fastest growing major economy\nOur cities and towns are on the Move We are building one hundred smart cities\nOur infrastructure is on the Move. We are building roads, airports, rail lines and ports at a quick pace.\nOur goods are on the Move The Goods and Services Tax has helped us rationalize supply chains and warehouse networks\nOur reforms are on the Move We have made a successful place to do business.\nOur lives are on the Move Families are getting homes, toilets, smoke-free LPG cylinders, bank accounts and loans.\nOur youth are on the move We are fast emerging as the world India is moving forward with new energy, urgency and purpose\nFriends,\nWe all know that, the mobility has been given to humanity.\nThe world is now in the middle of a new mobility revolution It is, therefore, important to understand mobility as a wider construct.\nMobility Better mobility reduces the burden of travel and transportation and can boost economic growth. It is already a major employer\nMobility is central to urbanization Motorized personal vehicles require ever-growing road, parking, and traffic infrastructure\nMobility is a key element of 'ease of living'. It occupies the minds of virtually every person: in time spent to get to school and work, in frustration with traffic, in the cost of visiting family or moving goods, in the public transport, access to the quality of our children breathe in concerns around the safety of travel\nMobility is critical to preserving our planet. Road transport accounts for five percent of global carbon dioxide emissions This threatens to choke cities and raise global temperatures.\nCreating a mobility eco-system is the need of the hour.\nMobility is the frontier in our fight against Climate Change. Better mobility can provide better jobs, better infrastructure, and improve the quality of life. It can also reduce costs Thus, the mobility sector impacts large public results.\nMobility, especially the digitization of mobility, is disruptive. It has big potential for innovation and it has been setting a searing pace!\nAlready, people are calling taxis on their phones, sharing bicycles in cities; buses are running energy, cars are going electric\nIn India, we have been able to focus on mobility. We have doubled our pace of construction of highways\nWe have re-energized our rural road-building program. We are promoting fuel efficient and cleaner vehicles. We have developed low-cost air connectivity in under-served regions. We are also starting operations on hundreds of new air routes.\nWe are pushing waterways in addition to traditional modes like rail and road.\nWe are reducing travel distances in our cities by efficient location of homes, schools and offices.\nWe have also started data-driven interventions such as intelligent traffic management systems.\nHowever, we also need to encourage pedestrians and cycling by taking steps to ensure their safety and priority.\nFriends,\nIn a rapidly transforming mobility paradigm, India has some inherent strengths and comparative advantages. Our starting point is fresh We have little of the legacy of resource-blind mobility.\nWe have fewer vehicles per capita than other major economies Thus, we did not take much of the baggage of other economies that were built on the back of private car ownership! This gives us the window of opportunity to create an all-new, seamless mobility eco-system.\nOn the technology front, our strengths lie in information technology, big data, digital payments, and the internet-enabled shared economy. These elements are increasingly becoming the drivers of the global future of mobility.\nOur unique identity program, Aadhaar, and its India-stack eco-system, has laid down a comprehensive public digital infrastructure. It has digitally empowered 850 million of our citizens India can demonstrate how to develop digital navigation.\nOur renewable energy push will ensure that the electric mobility can be fully realized. We plan to draw 175 GigaWatts of energy from renewables by 2022. We are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world. We are the sixth largest producer of renewable energy. We have also championed the cause of solar energy globally through the International Solar Alliance\nWe have a fast growing manufacturing base, especially in the automotive sector.\nWe also have a large, digitally literate, young population. This provides millions of educated minds, skilled hands and aspirational dreams for powering the future.\nSo, I am convinced that India is the best place to live in the 'Mobility Economy'.\nMy vision for the future of mobility in India is based on 7C's - Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-Free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge.\n1. General: Public transportation should be the cornerstone of our mobility initiative. New business models driven by digitization, are re-inventing the current paradigm. Big Data is enabling smart decision-making.\nOur focus should also go cars, to other vehicles like scooters and rickshaws. Large sections of the developing world\n2. Connected Mobility Implies an integration of geographies as well as modes of transport. The Internet-enabled Connected Sharing Economy is emerging as the fulcrum of mobility.\nWe will leverage the full potential for vehicle pooling and other innovative technical solutions to improve private vehicle utilization. People from villages should be able to bring their products to ease and efficiency.\n3. Convenient mobility means safe, affordable and accessible for all sections of the society. This includes the elderly, the women and the specially abled. We need to ensure that public transport is preferred.\n4. Congestion free mobility is critical Therefore, there must be ending bottlenecks of networks. This would result in fewer traffic jams It would also lead to greater efficiency in logistics and freight.\n5. Charged Mobility is the way forward. We want to drive investments across the value chain from batteries to smart charging to Electric Vehicle manufacturing. India's business leaders and manufacturers are now able to develop and deploy break-through battery technology\nThe India Space Research Organization uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space. Other organizations can partner with ISRO We want to build India as a driver in Electric Vehicles\nWe will soon put in place a stable policy-regime around electricity and other alternative fuel vehicles. Policies will be designed as a win-win for all, and enable huge opportunities in the automotive sector.\n6. Clean Mobility powered by Clean Energy is our most powerful weapon in our fight against Climate Change! This means a pollution-free clean drive, leading to clean air and better living standards for our people.\nWe should champion the idea of ​​'clean kilometres' This could be achieved through bio-fuels electric or solar charging. Electric vehicles in particular can complement our investments in renewable energy\nWe will do whatever it takes, because this is our commitment to our heritage, and our promise to future generations.\n7. Cutting-edge: Mobility is the internet in its early days. It is Cutting-edge It is the next big innovation sector The 'Move Hack' and 'Pitch to Move' are organized in the past week.\nEntrepreneurs should see mobility as a sector with immense opportunities for innovation and growth. It is a sector where innovations can solve problems for public good.\nFriends,\nI am convinced that the 'Mobility Revolution' is an enabler of our growth and development. When India transforms mobility, it benefits It also gets a scaled success story, for others to replicate\nLet us build a template,\nIn the conclusion, let me be especially special to the youth of India.\nMy young, dynamic friends, this is a new era of innovation. This is the future This is the sector that will absorb everything from those to doctors We should embrace this revolution, and leverage our strengths to lead the mobility innovation ecosystem both for ourselves and others.\nThe Talent and Technology assembled here today, has the capability of making a transformative mobility shift for India and the World.\nThis shift will be based on 'Caring for our World', and 'Sharing with Others'.\nTo quote from our ancient scriptures:\nCo nahavatu\nCum is to be done\nTejaswi na dhamditamastu ma diddhivar hai\nWhich means:\nMay we all be Protected\nMay we all be Nourished\nMay we work together\nMay be our Sharpened\nFriends!\nI look forward to see what we can do together\nThis summit is just the beginning Let us Move ahead.\nThank you.\nIndeed, India is the MOVE:\nOur economy is on the MOVE We are the world's fastest growing major\nOur cities and towns are on the MOVE.
