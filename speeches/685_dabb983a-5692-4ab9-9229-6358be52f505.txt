"Share\n\nEntire country is holding a watch on the parliament They are awaiting the Rail and General Budget: PM Modi\nWorld today is excited about India's advancing economy: PM\nHope the Budget session will be productive: PM\nWelcome friends!\nToday's budget session of Parliament is going on. The eyes of hundreds of millions of people in the country are centered on Parliament, on the proceedings of Parliament, on rail and general budget.\nToday, due to the situation in India's global economy, the world's attention is also on this budget session of India. There has been a continuation of discussion with all the parties for the last several days. The discussions are going on from above formalities. One-to-one is also going to be a lot of things. And this belief is mine, that Parliament will be useful for time, meaningful talks will happen. There will be deep meditation on the expectations and expectations of ordinary citizens of the country.\nAny meeting that has been done so far, the positive attitude which has been shown by all the Opposition parties, must be fully realized in the coming session, and in the coming days, the countrymen will definitely realize its full significance.\nI hope that the use of the House should be for deeper discussion. The government should also have a lot of criticism. The drawbacks of the government should also be exposed. And the only way is to strengthen democracy, to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the people.\nThank you very much colleagues"
