We both seek a concrete and effective outcome on climate change at COP 21 in Paris later this year.\nWe worked together for a separate goal on Climate Change in the Sustainable Development Goals, and in a manner that addresses the interests of developing countries.\nWe should also build closer partnerships in pursuit of our shared objectives in the WTO-for example on fisheries.\nThe United Nations is an historic milestone of its 70th anniversary. I have written to all members on charting the course for the United Nations for the years ahead.\nSeven decades after the United Nations was created, the world is a different place.
