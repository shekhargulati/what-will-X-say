And, across cultures and geography, people are increasingly taking to yoga to redefine their lives - to find oneness between their inner self and outer world; between their existence and their environment\nThe WHO fact sheet on the global burden of disease says that non-communicable diseases are leading causes of death worldwide. In 2008, 80 percent of deaths due to these diseases were in developing countries, up from 40 percent in 1990.\nBy 2030, low-income countries will have eight times more deaths attributed to NCDs than high-income countries.\nIn India, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and other non Communicable Diseases are estimated to account for 60% of all deaths. These diseases account for about 40% of all hospital stays and roughly 35% of all record outpatient visits.\nWe face the tragedy of productive life cut short and families that must deal with untimely loss; the huge toll on the economy; And, the excessive burden on the over-stretched health system\nSome studies have estimated that India stands to lose about 4.58 trillion dollars before 2030 due to non communicable diseases and mental health conditions.\nSo, we must address the question of psychological state of our existence as much as we try to advance our physical and material life.\nThis is where the role of Yoga is paramount Across the world, there are moving stories of transformed lives and rekindled hopes due to Yoga.\nThe prediction of Mr. Aurobindo that \"Indian Yoga ... is probably one of these dynamic elements of the future life of humanity\" is coming true.\nThis discipline was not originally considered or conceived as system of medicine. But, because Yoga is about aholistic lifestyle and the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual harmony, it has profound health benefits.\nIt fits well with the change in the way We are no longer satisfied with just preventing and managing diseases People now demand promotion of wellness, body and spirit\nWe now increasingly hear voices calling for holistic treatment, which means dealing only with the immediate illness, but with the full person, physically, psychologically, socially, and spiritually.\nTraditional Indian systems are rooted in human beings in totality. They see the link between Adhi or problems at the level of mind and problems at the physical level.\nThey probe deeper causes They can not just cure the disease They may take time to take longer to take effect, but they tend to have deeper and longer impact. And, they are without side effects\nAs I argued at Science Congress this morning, like traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature. So, we must recognize that science, as we see it, does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world.\nAnd, we must remember that the western system of thought, from Hippocrates to Percival to Edison has expressed views on health that are not fundamentally different from the philosophy of the Indian System.\nSo, along with the accumulated knowledge and experience collected over the ages, we must also test and validate results, assure quality and explain benefits.\nAnd, this is why we are placing emphasis on our efforts to increase awareness, adoption and adoption of AYUSH System of Medicine.\nAnd, in doing so, we will build wellness among people, rely more on local resources and healthcare costs.\nWe will also reduce the social and economic costs.\nI am not here to advocate I believe that humanity is richier for its diversity. Civilizations, cultures and countries have enriched each other by sharing their knowledge and wisdom. And, we could progress more than learning from each other.\nIt is in this spirit that Swami Vivekananda called for the best from the East and the West.\nSo, it should be in the area of ​​healthcare. My vision for healthcare is an integrated system that understands and builds on the best and most effective of different traditions.\nYoga, Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Modern Medicine by taking a platform. Your main focus on four major non-communicable diseases - Diabetes, Cancer, Psychiatric disorders , Hypertension and Cardiovascular diseases is appreciable.\nIt addresses issues\nModern systems of medicine have transformed healthcare; screening, detection and diagnosis of diseases Use of technology has reduced barriers to accessing health care, and improved our understanding of disease patterns Breakthroughs in medicines and vaccines have helped conquer and contain many diseases.\nBut, as our understanding of its limitations and its side effects have grown, as we have experienced the growing costs of modern medicine systems, we have to look beyond traditional systems, not just in India, but also in other countries as well.\nTheir popularity is growing. Yoga is now a global heritage And, the world is embracing traditional Indian medicine with great enthusiasm.\nSo, we look at this conference to define the path ahead in the service of humanity.\nI hope that health professionals, policymakers, government organizations and industry will bridge the gap between different forms of medical systems.\nI hope that you will integrate yoga and traditional Indian medicine more closely into our healthcare system and make wellness a part of life for all and rest of the world.\nYou will not only get healthy and happier life for people, but also to a more prosperous and peaceful world.
