"Her Excellency President Park Geun-hye,\nHer Highness Sheikha Mozah\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban ki-moon,\nMr. Bang Sang-hoon, President of Chosun-ilbo\nIt is a great honor to share the stage with President Park and Sheikha Mozah and Ban Ki Moon.\nThey are outstanding leaders of Asia They reflect Asia's diversity, and its common spirit\nI am happy to visit Republic of Korea\nLong before Korean brands had found their way in Indian homes, Koreans had found their way in Indian hearts.\nNearly a hundred years ago, India's great poet, Rabindranath Tagore called Korea the Lamp of the East. Today, Korea is proving him right.\nKorea's economic miracle and global leadership in technology has made the promise of the Asian Century more real.\nKorea is a pillar of democracy and a force of stability in Asia and Pacific.\nAsia's re-emergence is the greatest phenomenon of our era.\nIt started in Japan and then extended to China, Korea and Southeast Asian countries.\nIn the West, nations like Qatar are transforming their desert landscapes in booming economies.\nIt is now India's turn to sustain Asia's success\nIt is a nation of 1.25 billion people blessed with the extraordinary resources in the form of 800 million youth.\nIndia's potential has never been in doubt And, in the course of the year, we are translating into a reality; hope in confidence\nIndia's growth has rebounded to 7.5% per year; And, the prospects of further increase are strong\nThe world speaks in one voice\nThe progress of one-sixth of humanity will also be a chance for the world.\nIt will also give India the ability to do more for our world.\nAbove all, India's progress will be a Asian success story. And, it will help make our Asian dream a bigger reality\nThis is why Asia will get more more when all of Asia rises together\nAsia should not have two faces - one of hope and prosperity; The other of want and despair\nIt should not be a continent of nations. of regions with stability and others\nIndia seeks an Asia of shared prosperity, where the success of one nation becomes the strong of the other\nGrowth should be more inclusive within and across countries This is the obligation of national governments, but also a regional responsibility.\nThat is why I want to visit our neighbors.\nAs some of us become more prosperous, we need to share our resources and markets with those who need them.\nI am happy to see many people in Asia\nThis is the principle that guides India's policies And, it comes from our timeless belief in the world as a family \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\"\nWe must also empower our youth with skills and education,\nOver the next 40 years, three billion Asians will lift themselves in a higher level of prosperity Asia's prosperity and growing population would be a huge demand on our limited resources.\nSo, our footprint on earth should become lighter as our economic weight increases.\nThat is why I have often called for a change in lifestyle and new pathways to prosperity. And, I believe it is possible, without compromising our future\nAsia must also use its capacity for innovation and frugal manufacturing for affordable renewable energy.\nReverence for our shared heritage Combating Climate Change in our enlightened self-interest\nThat is why India has set a goal of 175 Giga WATS of new renewable energy capacity over the next five years.\nBut, coal and oil will remain the main source of energy. So, let us work clean and less harmful for Nature.\nOur vision of inclusive growth will be incomplete unless we pool our innovation and technologies to transform our region's agriculture.\nMany of us have similar ecosystems and rural economies And, we have a long history of learning from each other.\nBy 2025, a majority of Asians will live in cities. Many urban clusters in Asia By then, by some estimates, India will host around 11% of the global urban population.\nSo, creating livable and sustainable cities of tomorrow should be our collective goal.\nThat is why in India, I have placed so much emphasis on urban renewal and smart cities. And, there is much that we learn from cities like Seoul.\nIf Asia should rise as one, Asia should not be considered in regional fragments. Today, what happens in West Asia is a strong influence on East Asia. And what happens on the oceans will have influence on the Asian highlands.\nIndia is located at Asia's crossroads And, we will assume our responsibility to build a inter-connected Asia.\nWe must connect our regions through infrastructure and integrate them through trade and investments.\nWe must also do everything possible to ensure sustainable peace and sustainability for Asia.\nThis year, as we observe the 100th and 70th anniversary of the two wars, we should remember that peace is not inevitable.\nWe must build institutions that promote cooperation on the principles of equality, co-existence and international rules and norms.\nThis will also mean that we work together to protect our commons for the benefit of all - our oceans, outer space and the cyber space.\nThis is a responsibility of every nation\nIt is also our collective task against our common challenges - terrorism; trans-national crimes; natural disasters; and, diseases.\nAsia of dynamism, but also of uncertainties should lead in shaping its course.\nBut, Asia of growing weight also has to take greater responsibility for the world.\nAnd, it must also seek a big role in global affairs.\nWe must work as Asians to reform the global organizations of governance, including the United Nations and its Security Council.\nAsia's rivalries will hold us back Asia of Unity\nIn conclusion, I want to say this.\nThrough its history, Asia has been linked by the flow of religions, culture, knowledge and trade.\nAnd, Asia has also given much to the world - great religions, our staples such as tea and rice, some of the finest human creations, and some of the most significant inventions and technologies.\nWe have risen from tragic conflict and the long shadow of colonialism\nWe have also seen Asia's strength and spirit.\nLet us now draw on our heritage and synergies, our ancient wisdom and youthful energy, to pursue a common purpose.\nFor ourselves and the world\nThank you. Thank you very much Thanks a lot"
