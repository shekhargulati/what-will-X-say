"Ayubowan\nVanakkam\nI am very happy to talk to you in Jaffna today through Live Video Link.\nI am all the more happy that this is the occasion when the National Emergency Ambulance service is being extended over over Sri Lanka.\nThis event marks another major achievement in the development partnership of India and Sri Lanka.\nMy Friend Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe had talked about my visit to Sri Lanka in 2015 about establishing such a system in Sri Lanka.\nI am very happy that in July 2016, the first phase of the service started in the Western and Southern Provinces.\nDuring my visit to Sri Lanka last year, I had given the friendly people of Sri Lanka that India would work for expanding the pre-hospital. Emergency Ambulance Service all over Sri Lanka.\nI am happy that India has completed its promise in a timely manner and we have marked today\nI am also happy that this phase of expansion begins with the Northern Province. India is happy to work together with the wipingtears from the past and ushering in a bright future.\nI understand that the people associated with this service have been trained in India. The requiredskills and the local employment will also receive a boost.\nFriends,\nIt is not just a co-incidence that has the privilege of being the first responder service and its expansion in Sri Lanka's partner.\nIn good times and bad, India has been, and will always be the first responder for Sri Lanka.\nAs leaders of two democracies are full of diversity, both Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe and I believe in delivering benefits of all sections of the society.\nI appreciate the efforts of President, His Excellency Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe for meeting the aspirations of all citizens of Sri Lanka.\nFriends\nI have very fond memories from my two visits to Sri Lanka as Prime Minister. I have been overwhelmed by the love and affection, which was showered on me\nI also had the good fortune of being the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Jaffna. I could also participate in the UN Vesak day festival. All these are unforgettable experiences\nFriends\nThe existence of all countries is closely linked to their neighbors.\nWhen I look at Sri Lanka, I see not only a neighbor, I see a very special and trusted partner of India in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean family.\nI believe that our development cooperation with Sri Lanka is an important means for translating our vision of shared progress in reality.\nThree years ago, when I had the honor of addressing the Parliament in Sri Lanka, I had spoken about all possible steps for converting proximityinto close relations.\nI am reminded of what Mahatma Gandhi had said in 1927, when he visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Student Congress of Jaffna. He then had travelled from Matara in the South to Point Pedro in the North. Just before returning to Talaimannar, his words to the Reception Committee in Jaffna were: \"The message that I can leave for Jaffna as for the whole of Ceylonis: Let it not be\" out of sight, out of mind \".\nI have the same message today. Our people should be in constant touch with each other So that we know\nI would like to come to India and experience the new India that is taking shape.\nI am happy to learn that His Excellency Prime MinisterWickeremesingheville will visit India in early August.
