You are valued friends of India Some of you have been here earlier too many times One of you was born here and actually grew up in Vadodara!\nI am happy to see you I ask you all to come to your home and visit the Science City over the coming weeks.\nOur students will cherish this extraordinary experience of interacting with you It will inspire them to undertake new and significant challenges.\nI am very hopeful that this exhibition and this series will become a strong link between you and our students, science-teachers and our scientists\nMy government has a clear vision of where we want to be in the next 15 years. Science and Technology is the pivot on which the vision will translate into strategy and action.\nOur vision in Science and Technology is to make sure that all our youth That training and future preparedness should make our young employable in the best places That India should be a great science destination That should we take major inspirational challenges like deep sea exploration and cyber systems\nWe have a plan that will take this vision through action.\nOur scientists have been asked to teach students in our schools across the country. This will also include training teachers.\nAt the next level they have been asked to create new programs in both skilling and high-tech training.\nThese programs will make you employable in the new knowledge economy and make scientists You will be able to compete for positions and jobs here and anywhere in the world.\nNext, our scientists will link our laboratories in cities. You can share ideas, seminars and resources and tools. This will allow you to do more and better collaborative science.\nOur science agencies will expand science-driven entrepreneurship and commercialization in a big way in each state according to local needs Your start-ups and industry will then compete globally\nThese seeds should be planted in this year and we will see fruits come steadily.\nMy young friends, you are the future of India and the world. India offers an enabling and unique opportunity of a large demographic dividend and the best teachers.\nYoung students, you are the streams of knowledge and expertise. Your training and your future\nThanks to science and technology, the human race has flourished. Large numbers are enjoyable\nYet India has a great challenge to raise many from poverty. You will be scientists\nThe maturity of our science will also be judged by a responsible treatment of our planet by science and technology\nYou will be the scientists soon\nWe must have clear outcomes from the Nobel Exhibition and the Science City\nGlobally, science \u0026 technology has emerged as one of the major drivers of socio-economic development. In the fast growing Indian economy, there is growing expectations for scientific interventions.\nThere are three outcomes I would like to see from the Nobel Prize series.\nFirst, follow up students and their teachers. The students and teachers have been here through a national 'Ideathon' competition and hail from all over the country. Do not lose track of them.\nDuring the exhibition period, you could also get students from all over Gujarat.\nSecond, stimulate entrepreneurship locally There is a great entrepreneurial zeal in our youth\nOur science ministries have incubators here in Gujarat. In the next five weeks, you should have a workshop on how cutting edge science and technology-driven start-ups can be boosted.\nI am told that there are about ten Nobel Prize winning discoveries that have gone into a smart phone.\nPrize winning physics can save electricity bills and the planet The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was for the BLUE LED. This came from basic research by three Japanese scientists Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura. When combined with the previously known RED and GREEN LEDs, white light devices could be made that last a hundred thousand hours.\nThere are many such exciting discoveries being made that we can apply through enterprise.\nThird, impact on society\nMany Nobel Prize winning discoveries had a huge impact on our society through health and agriculture.\nFor example, precision medicine using the tools of gene-technologies is a reality\nWe should use this tool to study cancer, diabetes and infectious diseases.\nIndia is already a generics and bio-similar leader, with a major hub in Gujarat, but we will now try to become a leader in new bio-tech discoveries as well.\nI am happy that this exhibition has been planned at the Science City which connects to the community.\nIt is a great platform to engage with citizens to learn about global challenges we face.\nWe will strive to make this Science City a truly attractive, world-class place for young students and science teachers from all over the world. Center and State should collaborate and take up this challenge this year.\nMy young friends!\nThe Laureates represent the peaks of science and you must learn from them. But remember that the peak rises from great mountain ranges and does not stand alone\nYou are the foundation and the future of India You should build new ranges from which the peaks will arise. If we focus on the foundation, our schools and colleges and through teachers all miracles can happen. There will be hundreds of peaks from India But, if we ignore the hard work at the base no peak will magically appear\nBe inspired and be courageous, have courage and be your own person and not imitative That is how our honored guests succeeded and that is what you want to learn from them.\nI take this opportunity to thank the Nobel Media Foundation, the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India and the Government of Gujarat for organizing such an innovative program.\nI wish this exhibition a grand success and I am sure that you will benefit from it.\nOpportunities in science for the youth, India as a hub for research and innovation. pic.twitter.com/nT9bB6aXVj\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 9, 2017\nThe Prime Minister speaks at Science City in Ahmedabad. pic.twitter.com/qjGrhSdZqU\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 9, 2017\nScience driven enterprise and catering to local needs and aspirations through science pic.twitter.com/HULKnJ5eRn\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 9, 2017\nScience for the betterment of humanity pic.twitter.com/beOVOLPSca\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) January 9, 2017\n"
