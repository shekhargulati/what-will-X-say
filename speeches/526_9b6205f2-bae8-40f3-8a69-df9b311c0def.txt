"Share\n\nIndia has undergone a major purification drive to release it from the grip of corruption \u0026 black money: PM\n125 crore Indians have not decided to step in the drive against corruption: PM Modi\nDemonetization has seriously impacted black money and terror-financing: PM Modi\nIn this fight against corruption \u0026 black money, it is clear that people want to walk shoulder to shoulder with Govt: PM\nOfficials exposed through raids after notes will not be spared: PM Modi\nPM Modi announces a series of schemes that provide cheap housing for the rural and urban poor\nPrime Minister Modi announces new financial schemes\nMy fellow citizens,\nIn some hours, we will be in the new year of 2017. 125 crore Indians will join the rest of the world, in the new hope, new energy and new dreams.\nSince Diwali, our nation has been witness to a historical rite of purification. The patience, discipline, and resolve showed by 125 crore Indians, will play a critical role in shaping the future.\nIn God's creation, humans are endowed with fundamental goodness.\nWith time, the distortions of badness creep in People feel suffocated in a bad environment Corruption, black money, and counterfeit notes have become so rampant in India's social fabric.\nPeople were forced by circumstances, in defiance of their inherent goodness It feels like, that the evils and corruptions of society,\nknowingly or un - knowingly, intentionally or un-purposely, has become a part of our daily lives. Developments post-Diwali has shown, that crores of Indians were looking for a escape from this suffocation.\nWe have, during the external aggressions, of 1962, 1965, 1971 and Kargil; Credits Such collective energy and patriotism is under-standable, in the face of external threats.However, when crores of Indians unite to fight against internal evils, it is unparalleled.\nIndians have, with firm resolve and infinite patience, faced difficulties with a smile, re-defining the concept of sacrifice. We have lived these ideals 125 crore Indians have shown, in their fortitude, the importance we place in truth and goodness This is the sands of time.\nIndians have the power of people power, the utmost discipline, and the ability to understand the truth. They have shown that the truthfulness, can defeat the dishonesty.\nThey have seen how much, even people trapped in poverty, are willing to do, to build a glorious India The people, through persistence, sweat and toil, have demonstrated to the world, an unparalleled example of citizen sacrifice, for the bright future of a nation\nGenerally, when people's movements have arisen, the people and the government have been at loggerheads.\nIt is historic, that both the people and the government are the same The Government is aware, that in this period, you had to queue up, and face difficulty in withdrawing your own money. I received letters from many people They have shared their pain and sorrow with me, but also emphasized their support. You have talked about me as one of your own. In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you want to walk shoulder to shoulder with us For us in Government, this is a blessing.\nMy efforts are to take the banking system to fast as possible in the new year. I have asked all the officers in the work They have been specifically asked to solve problems in rural and remote areas.\nFriends,\nThere is no precedent globally, to what India has done Nations like us do not have the amount of currency Over the last ten to twelve years, 500 and 1000 rupee currency notes were used for less transactions, and more for a parallel economy. The excess of cash was fuelling inflation and black-marketing It was denying the poor, their due Lack of cash Our goal is to achieve a balance Economists agree that when cash is out of formal economy, it is a cause of worry. When it joins the mainstream, it is a opportunity for development.\nI am sure, if great sons of India like Jayaprakash Narayan, Lal Bahadur Shahastri, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Kamaraj had today, they had applauded the patience, discipline and resolutions of our countrymen.\nIn the past few weeks, there were many gratifying instances - it would take weeks to list them.\nIt is a healthy trend for any nation, when the people want to join the mainstream abiding by the law, and helping in the government.\nFriends\nHow long will we end up with facts? I would like to share some information with you, or make you angry According to information with the government, there are only 24 lakh people in India who accept that their annual income is more than 10 lakh rupees. Can we digest this? Look at the big bangles and big cars around you\nIf we look at any big city, it will have lakhs of people with annual income of more than 10 lakh. Do you feel that, for the good of the country, this movement for honesty, needs to be further strengthened?\nIn this fight against corruption and black money, it is natural to debate the fate of the dishonest. What punishment will they get? The law will take its own course, with its full force. But the priority of the government is now how is the honest, protect them, and ease their difficulty. How can honesty gain more prestige?\nThis Government is a friend of good people And it aims to build an enabling environment for the goodness.\nIt is also a bitter truth, that people have complaints of government machinery, and some government officers.\nThis reality can not be wished away No one can deny that government officials have a greater responsibility than common citizens\nTherefore, it is the responsibility of all of us in Government, at central, state and local levels, to protect the common man, help the honest, and isolate the dishonest.\nFriends,\nIt is accepted the world over, that terrorism, Naxalism, Maoism, counterfeit currency trade, drug trade, human trafficking - all of these depend on black money.\nThese evils have become a festering sore on society and governments\nDemonetistion has dealt a severe blow to these trades.\nToday, youth who turned the wrong path, are returning to the mainstream in large numbers. If we stay vigilant, we can now save our children from returning to those evil ways of violence and cruelty. The fact that this money was circulated in the banking system indicates the success of this mission.\nEvents of the last few days indicate that escape routes for the dishonest has all been sealed. Technology has played a big role. The habitual offenders will be forced to abandon their misdeeds and join the mainstream.\nFriends,\nThis also represents the country's banking system. During this period, bank employees have worked day and night.\nFemale employees too, working as part of this mission\nPost office staff, banking correspondents- all did exceptional work.\nAmid this hectic effort, some critics Some government officials have also committed serious offenses, and tried to take advantage of the situation. They will not be spared\nAt this historic juncture, I would like to make an appeal to the banks.\nHistory is witness that the Indian banking system has never received such a large amount of money, such as short time.\nWhile respecting the autonomy of the banks, I appeal to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities.\nIndia is celebrating the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay as Garib Kalyan Varsh. Banks should also They should take appropriate decisions in public interest immediately.\nWhen the policies and programs are created in clear objectives, only the beneficiaries are empowered, but both short term, and long term benefits are achieved. Spending is carefully scrutinized, and good results are maximized.\nThe more the villages, the poor, the farmers, the dalits, the tribals, the marginalized, the oppressed, the deprived and women are empowered, and financially enabled on their own feet, the strong the country will become, and the faster Will be the pace of development\nFriends,\nto further the theory of Sabka Saath - Sabka Vikaas, on the eve of the new year, Government is bringing some new programs for the people.\nEven so many years after independence, millions of poor do not have their own home When the black money increased in our economy, The Government has taken some big decisions to ensure homes for the poor, the neo middle class and the middle class.\nTwo new middle income categories have been created under the Urban Area in the Urban Area. Loans of up to 9 lakh rupees in 2017, will receive interest subvention of 4 percent Loans of up to 12 lakh rupees in 2017, will receive interest subvention of 3 percent\nThe number of homes being built for the poor, under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana in rural areas, is being increased by 33 percent.\nIn addition to this, another scheme is being put into place for the neo middle and middle class in rural areas. Loans of up to 2 lakh rupees in 2017, for new housing, or extension of housing in rural areas, will receive a interest subvention of 3 percent.\nFriends in the last few weeks, an impression was made to be made. Farmers have given themselves a fitting reply. Rabi sowing is up by 6 percent Fertilizer is up by 9 percent During this period, the government has taken care to ensure that farmers do not suffer from farmers, fertilizers and credit. Now, we have taken more interest in farmers.\nFarmers who have taken loan for the Rabi crop from District Cooperative Central Banks and Primary Societies, will not have to pay interest on such loans for a period of 60 days. Farmers who have paid interest during the last two months, will receive these amounts back, directly in their bank accounts.\nArrangements are being made to provide farmers also better access to loans from cooperative banks and societies. NABARD created a fund of 21,000 crore rupees last month. Now, Government is adding 20,000 crore rupees more to this. The loss that NABARD suffers by giving loans to cooperative banks and societies at low interest rates, will be borne by Government of India\nThe government has decided, that 3 crore farmers who have received Kisan Credit Cards, will be given RuPay debit cards within three months. Kisan Credit Cards were launched in 1998, but so far, it was necessary to go to a bank, to use them. Now, farmers will have RuPay Debit Cards, which they can use anywhere\nJust as agriculture is important for the economy, so are the medium and small scale enterprises also called the MSME sector. Government has taken some decisions in the interest of small and medium businesses, which will also boost jobs\nGovernment of India underwrites loans given by banks to small businesses through a trust So far, loans were covered upto one crore rupees. This limit is now being enhanced to 2 crore rupees. Earlier this scheme only covered bank loans Hereafter it will cover loans given by NBFCs as well. This decision will enable better access to credit for small shop-owners and small enterprises. Banks and NBFCs will not levy higher interest on these loans, as the Government of India is bearing the cost of underwriting them.\nGovernment has also asked banks to raise the credit limit for small industry from 20 percent of turnover to 25 percent.\nBanks have also been asked to increase working capital loans from 20 percent of turnover to 30 percent, for enterprises that transact digitally.\nMany people connected with this sector have made cash in the last few weeks. Banks have been asked to take this into account when deciding on working capital.\nA few days back, Government has announced a major tax relief for small businesses. Income of businesses with turnover of up to Rs. 2 crores was calculated on 8% of the turnover. Now, for such businesses income from digital transactions will be calculated at 6%. This will effectively reduce their tax liability by 25%.\nFriends,\nThe progress of the MUDRA scheme has been very encouraging. Last year, around 3 and a half million people have benefited from this. The Government now aims to double this, giving priority to Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes and Women A new scheme is being launched for pregnant women.\nWe are introducing a nation-wide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant women. 6000 rupees will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children. This scheme will help reduce the mortality rate, in a big way. This will help ensure nutrition before and after delivery, and improve the health of mother and child. So far, pregnant women in 53 districts were given financial assistance of 4000 rupees, under a pilot project.\nWe are initiating a plan for senior citizens. Banks often reduce their deposits, when they receive a large volume of money This should not adversely affect senior citizens. Under the scheme, Senior citizens will get a fixed interest rate of 8 percent for a period of 10 years, on deposits up to 7.5 lakh rupees. The interest will be paid monthly.\nFriends,\nPolitical parties, political leaders and electoral funding, figure prominently in any debate on corruption and black money.\nThe time has now come that all political leaders and parties feel the feelings of the nation's honest citizens, and understand the anger of the people.\nIt is true that from time to time, political parties have made the system\nI urge all parties and leaders to move away from a \"holier than thou approach,\" to come together in prioritizing transparency, and to take steps to free money.\nIn our country, people ranging from the common man to the President, have at some point or another, advocated simultaneous conduct of state and national elections\nThis is to break the endless cycle of elections, reduce election expenses, and minimize pressure on the administrative machinery.\nThe time has come to be seriously considered and debated.\nPositive change has been found in our country\nWe can now see a positive momentum towards digital transactions in India.\nMore and more people are transacting digitally\nYesterday, Government has launched a new, swadeshi platform for digital transactions - named BHIM after Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.\nBHIM stands for Bharat Interface for Money I call upon the youth, the trading community, and farmers to connect with BHIM as much as possible. Friends, the developments, decisions, and policies that were put in place after Diwali, will of course be evaluated by economists.\nIt will be good if social scientists also do the same\nAs a nation, India's villages, poor, farmers, youth, educated and uneducated men and women, have all displayed infinite patience and people power. In a short time, the new year of 2017 will begin. Exactly 100 years ago, in 1917, Mahatma Gandhi initiated a Satyagraha in Champaran. Now, a century later, we witness that the people of India continue to share that feeling toward truth and goodness.\nToday, Mahatma Gandhi is not among us But the path toward truth that he showed us, is still most appropriate. As we begin the centennial year of the Satyagraha, let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.\nWe can not allow this fight against black money and corruption to stop or slow down Firmness in truth is a guarantee for success A country of 125 crore, with 65 percent down the age of 35, having the means, the resources, and the capability, has no reason to stay behind.\nThe new year of the new year\nLet us all come together, to move forward overcoming obstacles and constraints.\nHappy New Year\nJai hind !!!\nAfter a few hours we will all welcome the 2017 New Year: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\n125 million Indians of India will welcome new resolutions, new pleasures, new zeal, new dreams: PM @narendramodi https://t.co/I88hu3Nre5 \u003c/ a\u003e\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\nImmediately after Diwali, our country became a witness of the historic purification yagna: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\nWhen we say that - something that does not end the celebration of ours, this has been shown by the countrymen: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\nHow much truth and goodness are for every Hindustani: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\nCan not do anything to create poverty, to create a glorious India: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\nThe suffering that the countrymen has suffered is the example of the sacrifices of citizens for the bright future of India: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) December 31, 2016\nYou do not want to stay behind even a step in the fight against corruption, black money, and Jallianot.
