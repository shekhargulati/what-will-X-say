"Arun Puri, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of India Today Group,\nAll the journalists in your group,\nAll journalists working in the newsroom,\nStringers associated with you,\nOther great guests here and my colleagues,\nI convey my best wishes to all the people associated with the INDIA TODAY Conclave.\nAs your group took part in Swachh Bharat Mission, made people aware, you are also eligible for congratulations.\nColleagues,\nI have been told that while leading the country, I have learned something, I share my experiences with you.\nWhen I came to Delhi after the 2014 elections, there really was not many things to experience. There was not much speculation about how the central government is moving, what are the systems, what the system is all about.\nAnd I believe that it proved to be like a boon for me.\nIf I was part of the old system, then after going to the election, it would fit like a groove and fit into it. But that did not happen.\nColleagues,\nI remember, before 2014, there was also a discussion in your studio that what Modi is doing in the world, it does not have to understand Modi, so what will happen to our foreign policy?\nBut in the past, you may have been seen in where the effect of India's foreign policy is today.\nHave you seen or not? ....\nCome on, you thought so.\nColleagues,\nToday's India is a new India. Replaced India.\nThe blood of each young soldier is precious for us.\nWhat happened before, how many people should be killed, the soldiers should be martyred,\nBut there was hardly any major action.\nBut now no one can dare to show eye to India.\nOur government is committed to taking every decision in the country.\nToday India is going on a new policy and practice and today the whole world has started to understand it.\nColleagues,\nToday's new India is fearless, fearless and decisive. Because today the government is moving ahead with the confidence of the 100 million Indians, with their faith.\nThis solidarity of Indians has created a fear among some anti-national people inside and outside the country.\nThe atmosphere that is created today, I would say this fear is good.\nWhen the enemy is afraid of India's feat, then this fear is good.\nWhen there is fear of bravery of soldiers in terror masters, then this fear is good.\nWhen fugitive is also afraid of seizure of law and property, then this fear is good.\nWhen a big family is scolded by mama's speech, then this fear is good.\nWhen the corrupt politicians suffer from fear of going to jail, then this fear is good.\nWhen corruption is also afraid of law, then this fear is good.\nColleagues,\nIn the decades after Independence, the country has taken a lot of support.\nNow this new India is moving forward on counting on its strengths, its resources, its resources, trying to overcome its basic weaknesses, reducing its challenges.\nBut with the increasing companions, this challenge has arisen in front of this India.\nThe challenge is, the tendency of being self-satisfied by opposing its own country and by making fun of your own country.\nI am surprised that today when the whole country is standing side by side with our army, some people are doubting on the army.\nOn one hand, while the whole world is supporting India in the fight against terror, on the other hand some parties are doubting our fight against terror.\nThese are the same people whose statements, whose articles are being used against India on Pakistani Parliament, Radio and Television channels.\nThese people have come to the country protesting against Modi, they are harming the country.\nI want to ask all such people from this forum today that you believe in the strength of our army or are you skeptical?\nI want to know from them that you trust our army or you trust those people who are promoting terrorism on our soil.\nbrothers and sisters,\nI want to tell all such people and parties that Modi will come and go, but India will always be there. Therefore, I request them, please for the sake of your political advantage, for the sake of confirming your intellectual ego, stop playing with the security of the country, stop weakening India.\nColleagues,\nThe country has felt the lack of Rafael today.\nToday, Hindustan is saying in a tone that if we had Rafael, what would happen?\nDue to earlier self-interest on Raphael and now politics, the country has suffered a lot.\nI tell these people to be clear that if Modi is to oppose, definitely, make the drawbacks in our plans, what is the effect of it, what is not happening,\nCriticize the government on this, you are always welcome, but do not oppose the country's security interests, the country's interest.\nKeep in mind that in the same vein of anti-Modi protests, terrorists such as Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed can not get support from terrorists, they should not be further strengthened.\nFriends\nThose who ruled the country for many years have had interest in two things - doles and deals.\nThe culture of doles and deals\nDo you know the biggest sufferers of this approach? Our Jawans and Kisans\nLet me talk about the defense sector first.\nWhy is it that those who rule the nation for so many years have so many defense scams in their era?\nThey started with Jeeps and later graduated to weapons, submarines, helicopters.\nIn the process\nIf a deal could not happen, defence modernisation could not happen.\nWho is every deal maker close to? Who is every middle-man close to? The whole nation knows\nAnd Lutyens Delhi, surely knows.\nFriends\nIt is common knowledge that our armed forces are required to regularly bullet proof jackets.\nIn 2009, our forces made a request for One lakh Eighty Six thousand bullet proof jackets.\nYou will be ashamed to know that not one, I repeat one bullet proof jacket was obtained from 2009 to 2014.\nIn our tenure we bought Two lakh thirty thousand bullet proof jackets!\nIn our tenure, the corridors of power are also free from middlemen because they know, this Government will not tolerate any corruption.\nNow, let me talk of doles Who in power loved giving doles\nThese doles were not aimed at empowering the poor\nThese doles were given so that the poor and poor people\nThe best example of this is the farm loan waivers\nNo economist or policy expert will ever say farm loan waivers can solve our agricultural issues.\nIt is a temporary balm at best.\nEvery ten years, UPA came out with a farm loan waiver idea.\nThey did nothing in their full tenure but at the eleventh hour, offered a farm loan.\nThere is nothing in tangible in their waivers.\nIt benefits 20% of the farmers\nStill, they love to fight on farm loans.\nWe have taken a different approach\nThe PM's Kisan Samman Nidhi, a comprehnsive scheme for farmer welfare.\nNo dole or deal - only good deed\nSix Thousand Rupees in three parts to 12 million farmers of India\nThe scheme was announced on 1st February and launched on 24th February. We worked 24 hours non-stop and launched it in 24 days!\nPreviously, this much time will be taken to a very important question - after which member of the family should we name the scheme?\nAnd unlike waivers, PM is a long term and long lasting assistance.\n2022 by Farmer's Income to Increase in Soil Health Cards, PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana, E-Nam - they are not doles, they are concrete long term measures.\nIt was the NDA Government that had the honor of bringing a historical hike in MSP for farmers\nWhen the previous government was in power, a file for MSP was kept in cold storage for nearly seven years.\nThus, while they work for 10% commission, we work with 100% mission and when a government works with a strong mission,\nall-round development becomes possible\n\nFriends\nOur fifty five months and the fifty five years of the governance\nThey had a 'token approach', we have a 'total approach.'\nFor everything, they had a token to offer. Let me elaborate.\nIndia has been battling poverty but they gave a token slogan- Garibi Hatao.\nHow to reach that was not specified\nBut, they went to place saying - Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao.\nIt was known that India needs to work on financial inclusion. For that they gave a token-bank nationalization\nThey did not like the poor but none of them are bothered to check if the doors of banks are open for the poor or not.\nTake the case of One Rank One Pension\nA forty year old was demanded in 2014, a token amount of five hundred crore rupees was added. They know very well But then again, token!\nAnd, the elections that were approaching\nBefore 2014, what was their poll plank - increasing gas cylinders from 9 to 12\nImagine - such a large national party, with years in government is reduced to fighting a poll on 9 to 12 cylinders.\nThis way of giving to us\nIf work has to be done, it has to be in totality, not with tokenism\nThat is why, all our initiatives aim for one hundred percent.\nJan Dhan - financial inclusion and banking for all\nHousing for All - a house for every Indian by 2022.\nAnd, we are making remarkable progress in this direction.\nOne Point Five crore homes have already been created, compared to 25 lakh homes made by UPA.\nHealthcare for All - Ayushman Bharat - no Indian must be deprived of good and affordable healthcare. 50 crore Indians will benefit from this scheme.\nOne Rank One Pension - compare their 500 crores to the thirty five thousand crores that was given by NDA Government as a part of OROP.\nUjjwala Yojana - while they were busy between 9 and 12 cylinders,\nWe have worked to give smoke free kitchens to crores of families\nPower for all - every village and every household should have electricity\nThe 18,000 villages in dark for seventy long years have now been electrified and now the focus is on household electrification.\nSo, you can see, both speed and scale.\nEverything has to be\nEnough of Tokenism, the time has come for a total transformation\nColleagues,\nTo date, it is known to ask good questions.\nBut today I want to ask some questions from today's forum.\nTo this day why millions of people were constrained to open defecation?\nTo date, why was the government not sensitive for the Hindus?\nTo date, why was the water of the Ganges so polluted?\nTo this day why the North East was neglected?\nTo date, why did not the National War Memorial for the brave warriors of our country?\nTo date, there was no National Police Memorial for our heroic mighty policemen?\nTo this day why the flag was not hoisted in the Red Fort in memory of the government of Azad Hind Fauj?\nIf I forward this series of questions on the stage till today, then hours can become a 'special bulletin'.\nWhether you say 'do not speak' or talk about these questions, make or create a series of sequels\nBut it is a fact that a meaningful attempt was made to connect the poor, the victims, the exploited and the deprived people of this country before the system.\nBut I have not come here to question only, I would also like to answer some without asking you what we have achieved and what we are getting.\nYou people call yourself 'fastest'. This is your tag line! - Fastest\nSo I thought that today I too tell you about yourself and your government how fast we are!\nToday, we are removing poverty in the fastest pace in India.\nToday, we are the fastest growing economy.\nSince 1991, we have increased the GDP growth at the fastest pace in the last 5 years.\nSince 1991, in the last 5 years, we have reduced the fastest rate of inflation.\nToday roads are being constructed at the fastest pace in the country.\nToday the development of railway is being done at the fastest pace.\nToday, we are building houses for the poor at the fastest pace.\nToday, the task of putting mobile manufacturing unit at the fastest pace in the country has been done.\nToday, the work of laying optical fiber network at the fastest pace in the country is being done.\nToday, the highest FDI is coming in the fastest pace in the country.\nToday the scope of cleanliness is increasing at the fastest pace in the country.\nSo like 'Fastest' is your tagline, so is the fastest 'LifeLine' of our government.\nbrothers and sisters,\nWhen I came to you in 2013, at that time I also told you a story of two friends. The story was that once two friends go to the jungle to roam. In the terrible forest, he had kept a good gun of his own, so that if a dreaded animal was found,\nProtect your life. He wanted to walk in the forest,\nThen a lion appeared in the forest, suddenly a lion came forward.\nWhat to do now, the gun was lying in the car and left there. There was a big problem, how to combat this situation, where do they run?\nBut one of them removed the gun license from his pocket and showed the lion that I have a gun license.\n\nCompanions,\nAt that time when I had told this story, the government had the same situation.\nThe previous government made the act very well, but there was no action in them.\nNow after coming to government, we also acted in action with the act ... I want to give some other examples of what has happened in the then and nowadays.\n\nColleagues,\nAnonymous Property Law was passed in 1988. But never implemented it. That is, the act has never been brought into action.\nOur government has done the implementation of this and seized the bona fide property of thousands of crores.\nIn the previous government, you have seen the situation of Food Security Act. It was brought by a lot of aggression. But when my government came, I was stunned to see that this Act has been implemented in only half-way states in 11 states.\nFor the first time, our government implemented this law in all the states and Union territories of the country. And ensured that its benefits reached to the public.\nEarlier it was the government official, that was the files and this was the office, but what was the result, you all know.\nToday, we emphasized the action and see the speed at which pace of development is taking place in the country.\n\nColleagues,\nIt is five years to say that this period from 2014 to 2019, but when you run on the development track, assess the performance of our government, you will feel as if you have returned after traveling decades of development.\nWhen I say this very strongly, it is the hard work of five years of our government and the blessings and participation of 100 million Indians.\nIt was time to meet the requirements of 2014 to 2019, while 2019 has an opportunity to fulfill the aspirations.\nFrom 2014 to 2019 it was time to reach the basic needs of every household,\nWhile there is an opportunity to fly for faster advance from 2019.\nThese journeys going forward from 2014 to 2019 and 2019 are the story of dreams changing.\nThe situation of despair is the story of reaching the summit of hope.\nThe story is moving from resolution to accomplishment.\nTogether we have read books in the 21st Century that India will be.\nWith the last five years of hard work and hard work, we have worked to strengthen the foundation of the country.\nThe foundation of this new building of a new India will be built on this foundation.\nToday I say with full confidence that yes, the twenty-first century will be of India.\nWith this confidence I conclude my point.\nYou called me at INDIA TODAY Conclave, gave me an opportunity to talk,\nThank you very much for all of this.\n"
