It is rain that gives flowers, not thunder\".\nThis is a great nation.\nA land where legends are born - of poetry and beauty, of valor and honors, of pride and generosity, of the warmest embrace of friendship and the strongest resistance for freedom.\nAnd, in this century, the great Afghan people have waged an epic struggle of courage and resolve to shape their future with vote and debate, not gun and violence.\nA country with an abiding faith in the tradition of Jirga has chosen the path of democracy. And, it has done it against challenges\nIt is a tribute to the countless, nameless Afghans who laid down their lives and sacrificed their future.\nTo the leadership of former President Hamid Karzai Saheb,\nwho led the nation with wisdom and determination from the dark days of despair\nTo President Ghani and CEO Dr. Abdullah for his vision and statesmanship\nTo you, Members of Parliament, for braving the violence in your house\nHonourable Members,\nSo, I stand here, on behalf of 1.25 billion friends in India, in admiration for your achievements, in gratitude for your friendship and solidarity for your future.\nAnd, today, I am humbled and honoured to join the President Ghani and all the members of the Afghan Parliament to dedicate this new habode of democracy to the Afghan country.\nWe could not have chosen a more special day than the birthday of one of the tallest leaders of our time, former Prime Minister and Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji. Eleven years ago, he dreamed of this project in partnership with Karzai Saheb.\nAnd, we are deeply touched that you have chosen to name one of the wings in the building at Atal Block.\nThis Parliament House brings our vision of our leaders, our people and the stones of our lands.\nAnd, the Atal Block unites us in spirit, because Atal means hero in Pashto and in Hindi it means to be firm. It captures the spirit of Afghanistan and of our friendship\nThis Parliament Complex is a small tribute to your country as well as a democracy. And, it will stand as an enduring symbol of the ties of emotions and values, of the affection and aspirations that bind us in a special relationship.\nHonourable Members,\nOur ties are as ancient as history\nOver the mighty Hindu Kush and through the forbidding Khyber Pass, monks, merchants and monarchs have linked us through knowledge, culture, religion, commerce and kingdoms.\nIn the Shifting Contours of History There were times we saw wars. But, through the ages, we have always enriched one other.\nIn the timeless Buddhist symbols of Aynak and Bamian and in the majestic monuments of Delhi, in our culture and art, in language and literature, food and festivals, we see our timeless relationships of the imprint.\nWe owe to ancient Afghanistan the gift of one of the great characters of Mahabharata, Gandhari.\nIn the achievements of Mauryan Empire or Shershah Suri, we see the connectivity that we now aspire to rebuild.\nThe words of poet Ahmed Shah Durrani may have expressed the longing of an Afghan king in Delhi, I forget the throne of Delhi, when I remember the mountain tops of my Afghan land.\nBut, in the heart of every Indian and Afghan, there is boundless love for each other We love each other's culture and cinema, music and poetry, food and festivals. And, now we admire each other's cricket\nWe are delighted that the Afghan National Cricket Team has found its home ground near Delhi and is practicing for next year's World Cup. And, i congratulatethe Afghan under 19 team that just beat Zimbabwe in its first home series.\nWe are just as proud that the Afghans look for India as a natural destination for education, health or a family home.\nIndians remembered the support of Afghans for our freedom struggle; the contribution of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, revered as Frontier Gandhi; and, the important footnote of that history, when, exactly hundred years ago, the first Indian Government-in-Exile was formed in Kabul by Maharaja Mahendra Pratap and Maulana Barkatullah.\nKing Amanullah once told the Maharaja, that India was not free, Afghanistan was not free in the right sense.\nHonourable Members,\nThis is the spirit of brotherhood between us\nAnd, when you started a new century, we were proud to stand in front of you.\nOur partnership has helped rural communities get schools, minor irrigation, health centers, welfare for children and opportunities for women.\nTogether, we have built roads that have brought areas closer;\npower transmission lines and power stations that light up Afghan homes;\nsatellite links that bring education, medical advice and communication to Afghan people\nAnd, we are helping the security forces become more mobile.\nThe organizations we are establishing together are helping rebuild agriculture and mining in Afghanistan, and make advanced medical care available in Kabul.\nNothing is more important for its human resources. So, we are happy that our scholarships and training programs are empowering Afghan youth with modern education and professional skills; Afghan government with resources to develop their country; and, the Afghan Security Forces with the ability to secure their nation.\nPower and water will flow out of Salma Dam soon The Stor Palace will again stand as a symbol of your priceless heritage. Our scheme of 1000 scholarships for each year for Afghan students in India will continue. We are pleased to respond to our special scholarship scheme in agriculture science.\nToday, I announce 500 scholarships for the children of the martyrs of Afghan security forces.\nAs soon as you are in our efforts, you are guarded and protected. We have faced daily threats, but we feel safe in your midst.\nTo every Afghan, who has risked or lost his life so that his Indian guest is safe, I convey the eternal gratefulness of India\nTo Indian diplomats, officers, engineers and doctors, who serve here with pride, to the families of our martyrs, I express the gratitude of Indians and Afghans.\nThere are some who did not like us. There were those who saw sinister designs in our presence here. There were others who were uneasy at our partnership. Some even tried to discourage us\nBut, we are here You never doubted the sincerity of our friendship And, you've seen the fruits of our partnership.\nYou have judged us by what you see, not what others see you, including about the mysterious Indian consulates\nYou know that India is here to contribute not to compete; to lay the foundations of future; to rebuild life, not destroy a nation\nYou know, as we do, that Indians and Afghans have always stood for one another, never against another\nYou are the crossroads of history And, your history tells us that you will never become yourself a theatre of competition; or serve the designs of others\nFor you live by the creed extolled by poet Kushal Khan Khattak that nation's honor and nation's fame on life they have a prior claim.\nSo, with your faith and your pace, India will continue to build Afghan capacity for governance, security and development, so that you can build a future that Afghans so richly deserve\nWe will do this from that responsibility But, we also have a commitment to peace and stability in our region.\nWe know that Afghanistan's success will require its neighbors. And, all of us in the region - India, Pakistan, Iran and others - must unite, in trust and cooperation, behind this common purpose and in recognition of our common destiny.\nWhen Afghanistan becomes a haven of peace and a hub for the flow of ideas, commerce, energy and investments in the region, we will all prosper together\nThat is why we are working to improve your connectivity by land and sea, including through Chahbahar in Iran.\nThat is why I hope that Pakistan will become a bridge between South Asia and Afghanistan and beyond.\nI hope that will be the day of prosperity in our region; When a Kabuliwala can once again come easily to win Indian hearts; When we in India can relish the wonderful fruits of Afghanistan; When Afghans do not have a great price to buy their favorite products from India\nFor this region's history And, it must be the path to its future\nBut, brave and tireless as the Afghans are defending their nations, Afghanistan will succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the border; When nurseries and sanctuaries are closed; And, their patrons are no longer in business.\nTerror and violence can not be the instrument to shape Afghanistan's future or dictate the choices Afghans make ..\nFor, the fire that is lit in Afghanistan, can never be covered, within these boundaries\nAfghans have the wisdom to seek peace with neighbors, but also the courage to defend their freedom.\nAnd, Afghans of all persuasions must\nKabul River Too many tragedies have darkened the mountain slopes Too many dreams have burned in the fire of a senseless conflict.\nYou can be Pushtoons, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras You can be Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs\nBut, you are proud Afghans who can come together as a nation and one people\nYou may have fought in the name of religion; or in the cause of identity\nBut, it is now for Afghans to come together in peace\nAs a wise Afghan said, A tree with a bitter seed, Will also bear a bitter fruit.\nYou have a glorious tradition of pluralism and respect for diversity and beliefs.\nThose waging war from outside The people who want to seek power through ballot Those who have destroyed homes should rebuild their nation For, this is your land\nAnd, it must be on your terms, on your genius, through your own process and your own spirit of brotherhood.\nNot driven by the calculations or ambitions of others.\nAnd, the future you build in peace and through dialogue must save the last decade and half It must have a place for every Afghan It must have space for everyone's aspiration And, it must be a nation, where every citizen is safe and full about his future.\nAnd, as Afghans take responsibility for their future, the world should stand in solidarity and support.\nWe should do that for the soldier from a foreign land who laid down his life in an Afghan village that he had never heard of and for a people he never knew; and, for the enormous sacrifices that Afghans have made a life that others take for granted.\nWe must support Afghanistan without time lines because the new clouds of extremism and terrorism are rising, even as the old ones continue to darken our skies; and, because Afghans are not only fighting for their future, but are standing up for all of us and a safe world\nThe world will become a better place when we experience the real wealth of Afghan people in their diversity and rich heritage.\nIt is time for all Afghans, everyone in the region and the rest of the world to come together.\nThe sacrifices should not go in vain.\nThe flame of hope should not die\nNo girl that steps in the world should slip in darkness of denied opportunities.\nNo son should face the choice of gun or refuge\nNo mother should bring a child into the world\nNo leader should lose a brother\nNo one kneeling in prayer in a mosque should be killed in the name of religion.\nNo elder should look back on his grandchild.\nEvery youth in Afghanistan should see a future in which IT stands for information technology, not international terrorism.\nFor, the promise and the opportunities of the 21st century belong to the Afghan youth\nFor India, this is a deeply held commitment.\nYour suffering is our pain\nYour dreams\nYour strength is our belief\nYour courage is our inspiration Above all, your friendship is our honor\nAnd, as is Hindi cinema's most famous Pathan character, Sher Khan in Zanjeer sang,\nYaari hai iman meera, Yaar meri zindangi Friendship is my faith\nThis is the creed of Afghans and Indians\nI am confident that Hope will return to your homes, Laughter in schools, Life in your streets, Prosperity in your cities, unity in your society and peace in your nation.\nAnd, at every step of your journey, India will be with you\nThank you.
