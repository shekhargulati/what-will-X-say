We want every citizen to have access to best medical treatments: PM\nThe Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi released the Platinum Jubilee Milestone book on Tata Memorial Center, at his residence in New Delhi today.\nMr. Ratan Tata, in his welcome address, thanked the Prime Minister for his support, on behalf of co-operation and vision towards affordable healthcare and cancer research.\nAddressing the audience of doctors and students of Tata Memorial Center via video conferencing, the Prime Minister hailed the invaluable contribution of Tata family towards humanitarian services and social responsibilities, specially in the field of cancer treatment, care and research.\nThe Full Text of the Prime Minister's Address on the occasion is extended below -\nMr. Ratan Tata,\nDr R., Director, Tata Memorial Center a. Badve,\nAll the doctors, students and colleagues of the Tata Memorial Center\n\nAll the best wishes to all the people on the occasion of Platinum Jubilee of the Tata Memorial Center.\nI am very happy to release the Platinum Jubilee Milestone Book, when 75 years of Tata Memorial Center is over.\nThe Tata Memorial Center has been an invaluable contribution of the Tata family's continuous service and their feeling of social responsibility to reach this position.\nToday, this institution has the opportunity to remember all those people who have been involved in these 75 years.\nReversing the pages of this book, I found a sentence in 1931. At that time, when Mehrabbai Tata ji went to America for cancer treatment, she told her husband Sir Dorabji Tata: \"I'm lucky that I'm going to America for treatment but how to treat those millions of people in our country whose There is not enough resources nearby \".\nDue to the demise of Mehrbai ji, Dorabji Tata remembered this point and further it became the basis of the Tata Memorial Center.\nToday 75 years later, the Institute is a major center for cancer treatment, cancer treatment and research on cancer.\nThere are very few institutions in the country that have been engaged in nation service for so many years.\nThe way this institute has worked for the treatment of millions of poor, it is also inspiration for the rest of the hospitals in the country.\nThis institute is also an example of how government and private organizations can work together to serve the poor.\nThe effect of serious diseases such as cancer is like going through a fire test for any family. Trouble, mental discomfort, and the question of money - all are connected to it.\nWhen the poor read ill, the first thing in front of him is the bread and job crisis.\nTherefore, when institutes like Tata Memorial Center, those working in it, do one day, treat them, treat them, reduce their suffering, then it is a big service to humanity.\nI congratulate Ratan Tata Jee, the Tata Memorial Center and the people associated with it once again after 75 years of completion of the Tata Memorial Center.\nColleagues, cancer is one of the biggest challenges before humanity. Cancer alone is found in more than one million people every year in our country alone. Every year 6 million people die from cancer.\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer has expressed the hope that this number will double in the next 20 years.\nIn this situation, it is necessary to bring different cancer hospitals on a platform to provide treatment to every patient.\nA platform where cancer patients can get cheaper treatment, and modern techniques should be used during treatment.\nWhen this government was formed in 2014, 36 institutions of cancer were connected to the Cancer Grid. Now on today's date, the center has exactly double the number of 108 cancer centers linked to this grid.\nJust a few days back Digital Cancer Nerve Center has been started. In the same way, with the help of the Virtual Tumor Board, different types of cancer experts are being assisted in setting up the patient's treatment by connecting to the internet at the same time.\nTaking advantage of the experience of the Tata Memorial Center in the field of cancer, taking advantage of its expertise, with the help of this, four more major cancer institutes are being established in the country.\nThese cancer centers will be made in Varanasi, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam and Guwahati. This will help patients reaching the hospital with a long distance for treatment.\nApart from this, the National Cancer Institute is being constructed in Jhajjar, Haryana.\nFriends, the goal of the government is to get cheaper cheap cheaper than poor people and meet all the facilities.\nKeeping this goal in mind, after 15 years, a National Health Policy has been created in this Government.\nThe Government wants to bring the Preventive and Promotive Health Care System to the public. The government's intention is to spend 2.5 percent of GDP on health in the coming years.\nIt will also work on how to integrate different methods of therapy in a new health policy. Like allopathy, the other problems that the patient needs to raise during the treatment of cancer, in Ayurveda and yoga can get very much.\nYour institution can also take any initiative about this.\nCompanions, even today 70 percent of medical devices in the country come from abroad. This situation has to be changed too and because these are also a big reason for costly treatment. Therefore, under the new health policy, the government is encouraging the construction of medical equipment in India itself.\nIt also has a big role in institutions like the Tata Memorial Center.\nWith the help of doctors from your center, Bhabha Atomic Research Center developed the indigenous radiation machine \"Bhabharron\".\nWhen I went to Mongolia two years ago, the country gave Mongolia \"Bhabhatron\" gift.\nTherefore, in order to make cheap machines, better machines, we have to work together.\nTo strengthen the healthcare system across the country, the government is opening new AIIMS (AIIMS), modernization of medical colleges, seats are increasing at the graduate and post-graduate level.\nBharatiya Jan Dushyami Project has been started for poor people for cheap medicines. More than 500 medicines have been reduced to a list of essiancial medicines.\nYou have seen how the cost of stunts has also decreased by 85 percent. There are many such decisions which the Government has taken into consideration in terms of affordable healthcare.\nColleagues,\nPeople with healthcare have to keep in mind that health care services do not make commodities. There is no business to treat a sick, it should never be forgotten.\nAlso, do not forget that the person of any other profession has not got God's status. The faith of the millions of people in the country is in you and you are God for them.\nIn the end, I congratulate you all on the completion of 75 years of Tata Memorial Center. Thank you again for this, giving you the opportunity to release your Milestone Book.\nJai Hind !!!\nCancer is no less than 'Agni Parisksha' for anyone Contributions of Tata Memorial Hospital towards its cure is laudable: PM @narendramodi"
