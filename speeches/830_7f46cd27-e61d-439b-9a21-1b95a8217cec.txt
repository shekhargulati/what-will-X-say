Your perspectives are very important to us\nLet me reassure you that we will remain very sensitive to your concerns in international forums. We will also like to increase our needs and priorities.\nLet me share my thoughts with you on a few global issues and propose a few initiatives for our cooperation.\nClimate change Combating it is India's national priority. We make this choice with the natural instinct of our heritage and culture. But, we also do this in our enlightened self-interest and our commitment to the future.\nThat is why we have set a target of additional capacity of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. National action successful only through a strong international partnership As much as we speak of goals and emission reductions, we should focus on equally on access to affordable technology and adequate finance that makes transition to clean energy natural and easy. Otherwise, experience shows that targets will remain difficult. We should equally seek a global commitment to support.\nIndia will work with you and others for a comprehensive, balanced and fair outcome at COP 21 in Paris.\nYour interests\nExcellencies,\nAs I mentioned in my opening remarks, reforms of the UN Security Council is in global interest and vital for a more inclusive and equitable world.\nAs I said before, we should quickly adopt the draft presented by the President of the General Assembly as well as the negotiations during the 70th Session of the General Assembly.

We could start immediately with research collaboration and capacity building in institutions in India.\nWe will also be pleased to hold an international conference on \"Ocean economy and Pacific Island Countries\" in New Delhi in 2016. We will be delighted to host officers and independent experts of all 14 Pacific Island Countries.\nIndian Navy has provided direct support and capacity building to island states in Indian Ocean, specifically for coastal surveillance and hydrographic surveys. This has helped them get a better understanding of their maritime zone and strong security of their EEZs. We will be able to extend this assistance to our Pacific Island partners.\nWe also look forward to goodwill visits by Indian Navy to Pacific Islands The ships could also extend support in areas like healthcare through medical camps on the islands.\nNot only is our future closely linked to Space and Oceans, there is also a close relationship between the two.\nSpace assets and technology can help in inventory of land and water resources; fish zoning; forest resources management; coastal and ocean studies; weather and climate change; and, disaster management support\nWe can assist in establishing a 'Space Technology Applications Center' in any one of the Pacific Island Countries for the entire region and enhancing our support for training in space applications, including customized courses.\nFiji's support for our mission We hope to continue receiving support from Pacific Islands for Telemetry, Tracking and Command for our missions in the future.\nWe are all increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters, but we can reduce their human impact.\nIndia will be pleased to create capacity in Island States to deal with natural disasters, including through human resources development and application of space technology for early warning system and incident response.\nHuman resource development There is no other form of cooperation that is as effective in building a nation's future.\nFor the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation training program, Fiji will get 110 slots, and the number of slots for the other 13 countries will be doubled from 119 to 238.\nIn addition, we will offer two scholarships for college education in India to each of the 13 countries that have not received them yet, while continuing with the 33 scholarships currently offered to Fiji.\nWe will expand our training courses for Pacific Island diplomats and, in addition, offer a two-week business management course at the globally renowned Indian Institute of Management in Bengaluru.\nDuring the last three years, India has trained 43 rural women from 8 island countries as solar engineers. We now commit to train 70 women solar engineers and to provide solar electrification to 2,800 houses - 200 houses in each Pacific Island Country. This will save kerosene worth about a million US dollars and provide livelihood to women.\nI am pleased to announce that we will be established in the field of technology. This will only improve local IT infrastructure, it will enable us to fulfill our commitment to tele-medicine and tele-education to the people.\nWe are ready to do our business. In addition to the FIPIC Trade Office in New Delhi, we can support the development of micro, small and medium enterprises and will extend support for purchase of machinery for coconut processing and enhancing rice and sugarcane yields.\nWe will also improve market access for Small Islands Developing States. We will focus on developing services in your countries.\nSupply of generic drugs from India is presently routed through third countries and, therefore, very expensive. We are ready to set up a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and distribution center in the Pacific Island region and are pleased to offer a Line of Credit for this project.\nHuman bonds are the strongest foundation for enduring relationships\nLast year, we had announced electronic visas for Pacific Island countries. I am pleased to announce that we have given the free visa to the citizens of Pacific Island countries.\nPrasar Bharti, India's national broadcaster is happy to gift television and radio programs on culture, entertainment, news, education, etc., in English and Hindi to your countries.
