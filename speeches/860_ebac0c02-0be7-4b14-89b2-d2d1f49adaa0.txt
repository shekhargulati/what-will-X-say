You are a person of learning and many talents. I learned today that your skills in Hindi and yoga are among them.\nIt is a great privilege to embark on a tour of all five nations of Central Asia. This is the first time this happened\nI am truly excited to visit a great country and a great area that has called the pivot of human history.\nIt is a land of beauty and cultural splendor, of outstanding achievements and great heroism.\nIt is also a region of continuous engagement with India since human civilization.\nSo, I have come here, drawn by history and goodwill and as a neighbor, to write a new chapter in an ancient relationship.\nTonight, as I spoke to the people of Central Asia, I could not have a better place than the Nazarbayev University.\nIn its short life, it has emerged as a excellent center of education. And, I congratulate the first batch that has graduated this year.\nThe university reflects the vision of President Nazarbayev that is the nation's progress and leadership.\nIt recalls the wisdom of the great Kazakh writer, Abai Kunanbaev, who spoke about education as the shield and pillar for Kazakh people.\nToday, Kazakhstan is a nation of global stature and respect. This is not just because Mother Nature has been generous with resources of every kind.\nIt is your investment in education, human resources and infrastructure. The last ten years\nIt is your leader in advancing peace and cooperation in the Eurasian region.\nIt is your vision that has given us the Convention on Interaction and Confidence Building in Asia.\nKazakhstan is a voice of responsibility and maturity in international forums, including the United Nations.\nNo Indian will forget Kazakhstan's generosity in making way for India's bid for the membership of the UN Security Council in 2011-12. We are confidently behind your bid in 2017-18\nLike Kazakhstan, the rest of Central Asia It is just over two decades since nations here gained independence and regained their identity.\nThe countries of Central Asia are endowed with rich human and natural resources.\nI am coming from Tashkent. Uzbekistan is experiencing rapid economic growth and progress. Turkemistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgystan are turning their resources into a promise of a more prosperous future.\nYou have built modern, inclusive and pluralist countries at a time when many people in the region are caught in conflict and unrest.\nYour success as the world\nCentral Asia is the crossroads of Eurasia. It has been caught in the currents of history and it has also been shaped.\nIt has seen and fall of empires It has been witnessed in trade.\nFor monks, merchants and monarchs, it has been both - a destination and a passage.\nIt has been an intermediary of cultures and faiths from across Asia.\nYour gifts to human civilization Your Imprint\nAnd, over the last two thousand years and more, India and Central Asia have influenced each other profoundly.\nFor centuries, Buddhism flourished in this part of the world and even influenced Buddhist Art in India. Through here, it spread eastward\nAs I stood in the Gandan Monastery in Mongolia this May, I marveled at that journey of faith that linked Asia across its daunting landscape.\nThe confluence of Indian and Islamic civilizations took place in Central Asia We enriched every other not only in spiritual thought, but also in medicine, science, mathematics and astronomy.\nThe Islamic heritage of both India and Central Asia is defined by the highest ideals of Islam - knowledge, piety, compassion and welfare. This is a heritage established on the principle of love and devotion. And, it has always been the forces of extremism\nToday, this is an important source of strength that brings India and Central Asia together\nThe richness of our ties is written in our cities and our daily lives. We see this in architecture and art, handicraft and textile and in most popular food.\nThe Dargahs of Delhi resonate with Sufi music that draws people from all faiths.\nThe cities of Central Asia have become centers of yoga and Hindi, long before the world came together to celebrate the International Day of Yoga on 21st June.\nUzbekistan has recently completed fifty years of radio broadcast in Hindi. Our epics Ramayana and Mahabharata were popular on Uzbek TV as they were in India.\nMany of you are waiting for the release of the latest Bollywood film with the same excitement as people in India.\nThis is the source of goodwill between our people It is the foundation of a relationship of hearts and emotions. And, it can not be measured only by the scale of trade or the demands of states\nIt was evident when President Nazarbayev and the leaders of other Central Asian Republics came to India soon after their nation's independence.\nSince then, our political involvement has been deepened Our Defense\nTrade is expanding Our cooperation in energy sector has begun Later today, we will launch the first oil well in Indian investments in Kazakhstan.\nIndian investments in Central Asia have started And, so have Indian tourists in growing numbers More than 50 flights a week And, it takes about the same time as it will fly to Chennai from Delhi.\nOur strongest progress is in human resources development Thousands of professionals and students from Central Asia have trained in India Many from India\nWe have established Centers of Excellence in Information and Communication Technology in the region. And, we are also happy that we have three Indian cultural centers in the region.\nYet, we will be the first to say that the engagement between India and Central Asia falls short of its promise and potential.\nWe have a special place in our hearts But, we have not paid as much attention to each other as we want\nThis will change\nThat is why I am travelling to all five countries in the region.\nBoth India and Central Asia can not get their full potential without a second Our cooperation without our cooperation\nIndia constitutes one-sixth of humanity It is a nation of 800 million youth who is an enormous force of progress and change for India and the world.\nOur economy is growing at 7.5% every year. We can maintain high growth rates.\nIndia is the new frontier of opportunities for the world.\nCentral Asia is a vast area of ​​immense resources, talented people, rapid growth and a strategic location.\nSo, I am here to start a new era in our relationship with Central Asia.\nIndia is ready to invest more in a new partnership of prosperity\nWe will work together not just in minerals and energy, but in industries such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, engineering and small and medium enterprises. We can invest in refineries, petrochemicals and fertilizer plants here.\nWe can harness our strength in information and communication technology. Today, I will inaugurate a Center of Excellence in Astana with a Super Computer from India.\nWe can use the technology for development and resource management.\nI also see vast opportunities in areas like agriculture and dairy. We can renew our old ties in traditional medicines.\nCentral Asia is a natural destination for the Indian tourists.\nWe are intensifying our markets in culture, education and research. And we will connect our youth more\nIn this troubled world, we must also strengthen our defense, our countries' security and our region's peace.\nWe live at the frontier of instability We live close to the crucible of extremism and terrorism.\nWe see terrorism spawned by nations and groups Today, we also see cyber space becoming a platform without borders for terror\nFrom theatres of conflicts to the calm neighborhoods of distant cities, terrorism has become a global challenge as never before.\nIt is a force that is big and more enduring than its changing names, locations and targets.\nSo, we must ask ourselves: Will we go a generation of youngsters lost their guns and hate, because they will be accountable for their lost future?\nSo, during this visit, we will strengthen our defense and security cooperation in the region. But, we will also fight terrorism by the power of our values ​​and our commitment to humanism.\nThis is a responsibility that India and Central Asian countries owe to our shared inheritance and to our region.\nOur shared values ​​and aspirations are also found in the United Nations.\nBut, in a transformed world, we also see the growing institutional erosion of the United Nations. As nations that are committed to international order, we must work on our times. So, as the United Nations turns 70, we should press for reforms of the United Nations, specifically its Security Council\nIndia's membership of Shanghai Cooperation Organization will deepen our regional partnership\nAnd we have begun a study on a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union for deep integration with this region.\nThis is an era in which Space and Cyber ​​is making roads and rails less relevant.\nBut, we will also restore our physical connectivity for trade, transit and energy.\nThe International North South Transport Corridor opens a competitive and quick route for India to Eurasia. And, I hope all of Central Asia will join it.\nWe hope to join the Ashgabat Agreement on trade and transit.\nIndia's investment in Chahbahar Port in Iran will bring us closer to Central Asia\nI also hope that we can restore the traditional route to Central Asia through Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nWe can draw confidence from the agreement between Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India on the gas pipeline.\nThis region has been successfully connected.\nIndeed, our hopes of an Asian Century will be realized, when we see Asia as one - not as South, West, East or Central Asia will rise\nFor that, we will connect Asia's different parts.\nIndia is the crossroads of Asia's land and sea routes. We understand our responsibility. And, we are working on an understanding of the east and the west, by land and sea.\nThere is a surge of interest in reconnecting Asia with itself and beyond.\nOur former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji called for a new Silk Route initiative in 2002.\nToday, all of Asia seeks the glorious ancient Silk Road.\nBut, we must also remember\nThe Silk Road flourished and waned with the fortunes of Central Asia.\nThe End of the Silk Road did not just come from the rise of the sea.\nIt also happened because Central Asia was no longer a bridge between regions, but the new fault line between great empires to the east, west and south;\nWhen it was no longer the hub of trade, but a land in the shadows Central Asian Nations\nThe success of connectivity through and across Central Asia is important.\nFor that, the great nations of Central Asia must flourish and re-enter their central role in Eurasia.\nFrom Europe to Asia, all countries must be a weather and tourism, not competition and exclusion, in this region.\nThe region must remain stable and peaceful, free from conflict and terrorism.\nAnd, as Central Asia links the East and the West, it must also connect to the south.\nFor that is always\nIn an age of globalization, Asia can not remain fragmented. And, Central Asia can not remain distant and disconnected from India\nI am confident that we can make it happen Our ancestors crossed the mighty Himalaya, Karakoram, Hindu Kush and Pamirs for spiritualism, knowledge, and markets.\nWe will all work together to build the Silk Route of the 21st century. We will connect through space and cyber as we will by air, land and sea.\nLet me conclude with some lines from Abdurheim Otkur, a poet of this region. He said:\n\"Our tracks remain, our dreams remain, everything remains, far away, yet\nEven if the wind blows, or the sand shift, they will never be covered, our tracks,\nAnd the caravan will never stop the way, though our horses are very thin;\nOne way or another, these tracks will be found someday, by our grandchildren;\nOr our great grandchildren. \"\nI say this to: India and Central Asia will redeem that promise.\nThank you."
