Almost all of them have visited India So, it is really an honor for me to welcome such a great friend and strong supporter of India. Cyprus and India share rich legacies of ancient civilizations and, our civilizations have influenced one another through the millennia. In modern times, our relationship goes back to the pre-independence era, when our founding fathers are supported by the freedom struggle of Cyprus. And, Cyprus too has always reciprocated with its warmth and friendship. India has always stood by Cyprus In 1974, India took a firm stand in support of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. India has contributed to the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus. Three force commanders from India served in this capacity, and it is heartening for me to know that all of them are fondly remembered in Cyprus.\nExcellency,\nI'm aware of the problem. You have led from the front in trying to bring a new era of peace, development and security. Not just for you We wish you every success in your efforts Under your leadership, Cyprus has successfully overcome its recent financial and banking challenges. And, recorded one of the highest growth rates in the Euro zone in 2016. Excellency, We commend your vision and lead to the crisis of economic prosperity.\nFriends,\nToday, the President and I had detailed discussions. Our conversation covered the full range of bilateral relations. We also exchange views on mutual concerns. Cyprus and India enjoy close economic ties Cyprus is the 8th largest investor in India Last year, to boost our capital and investment links, we have revised the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. The President and I agree that India offers excellent investment opportunities for Cypriot entrepreneurs. My government has launched flagship programs through the attractive business partnerships in the industry and business in our two economies. The beautiful landscapes of Cyprus and the wide horizons of 'Incredible India' have both our countries in tourism promotion of a source.\nFriends,\nIndia and Cyprus share the common goal of the United Nations Security Council Both of us believe that a reformed Security Council, reflective of the world as it is, and not as it was, is necessary to address the range today. Excellency, in this context, I deeply appreciate your support for India's claim for a permanent seat in a UN Security Council. The President and I also discussed ways of strengthening our partnership in other inter-governmental organizations and regimes.\nFriends,\nGiven its location, Cyprus appreciates the threat that terrorism poses to the global peace and stability India itself has been battling We agreed that there is a urgent need for all countries to decisively act against those states who generate, support, shelter and sustain these factories. The President and I discussed the need for a comprehensive global legal framework, particularly through early conclusions of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.\nExcellency,\nI share with you the strong commitment to a new level. I am confident that our discussion and decisions today will give our partnership to a new direction and depth. Let me welcome you once again to India, and wish you a fruitful and productive stay.\nThank you.\nThank you very much\nPM @narendramodi begins his press statement, heartily welcomes President of Cyprus- gr8 frnd \u0026 strong supporter of India\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: Civilisns of Cyprus \u0026 India 've been influencd from each othr thru millennia, our founding fathrs suprtd freedom struggle of Cyprus\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: India firm in support of sovereignty, unity \u0026 tertrl intgrity of Cyprus; contrbtd\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi commends Cyprus Prez 4 leadng a new era of peace, dvlpmnt, security; Cyprus recorded one of the highest growth in Euro zone.\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: The President and I agree that India offers excellent investment opportunities for Cypriot entrepreneurs\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: Beautiful landscape of Cyprus \u0026 wide horizons of 'Incredible India' cn b sources of tourism promotion in both countries\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: Deeply appreciates Cyprus's support for India's claim for a permanent seat in a UN Security Council\n- Gopal Baglay (@MEAIndia) April 28, 2017\nPM @narendramodi: V agrd on need 4 all countries 2 decisvly act agnst states, suprt, shltr \u0026 sustainable factories in our rgns."
