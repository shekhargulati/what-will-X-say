I thank and congratulate the P.N. Panicker foundation for organising this Knowledge of greater than knowledge\nFriends\nKerala has a torch-bearer and inspiration to the nation.\nThe first 100 percent literate city and first 100 percent literate districts have been from Kerala. Kerala was the first state to reach 100 percent primary education. Some of the oldest colleges, schools and libraries of the country are also situated in Kerala.\nThis could not have been achieved by Government alone. Citizens and social organizations have played an active role in this remarkable achievement. Kerala has set an example I admire the work of people like late P.N. Panicker and his foundation. Mr. P.N. Panicker was also the driving force behind the library network in Kerala. He did this through Kerala Grandhasala Sangham set up by him in 1945 with 47 rural libraries.\nI believe that reading and knowledge should be limited only to work related aspects. It should help develop habits of social responsibility, service to the nation and service to humanity It should cure the evils It should spread the idea of ​​peace with the nation and integrity of the nation.\nIt is said that a literate woman can educate two families. Kerala has set an example\nI learn that PN Panicker Foundation together with a number of government agencies, private sector entities and civil society organizations, is leading a initiative of reading.\nTheir goal is to reach 300 million under-privileged people by 2022. The main objective of this mission is to promote reading as a means to grow and prosper.\nReading can help A well-read population will help India excel globally\nWith the same spirit, I had started a similar movement by name of VANCHE GUJARAT when I was Chief Minister of the State. It means \"Gujarat Reads\" I got a public library to motivate people The movement targeted the young generation, in particular I also requested citizens to think about building a 'Granth-Mandir' - a temple of books - in their village. This could be started with 50 or 100 books.\nI appealed to people Such a move\nFriends!\nFrom the time of the Upanishads people with knowledge We are now in the age of information Even today, knowledge is the best guiding light\nI am told that as a pilot project of Digital Libraries, Panicker Foundation is working with 18 public libraries in the state in collaboration with Indian Public Library Movement, New Delhi.\nI would like to see such a reading and library The movement should not be limited to making people literate. It should try to reach the real goal of bringing social and economic change. The foundation of good knowledge should be followed by a super-structure of a better society.\nI am happy to note that the State Government has announced 19th June as the reading day. Obviously, a lot of effort will converge to make this a popular activity.\nThe Government of India has also provided support to the activities of the foundation. I am told that about 1.20 crore rupees have been given in the last two years.\nI am also happy to see that the focus is on digital literacy. This is the need of the hour\nFriends!\nI believe in people's power It has the ability to make a better society and nation\nI urge every young person in the audience to take a pledge of reading. And they\nTogether, We can once again make a land of wisdom and knowledge. Thank You!\nKerala's success in education could not be achieved by Govts alone Citizens \u0026 social organizations have played an active role: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) June 17, 2017\nMr. P.N.
