The University also showcases the shared history and similar experiences of India and Kenya as two developing countries.\nJust now, before entering this auditorium, I paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, whose statue at this University was unveiled exactly 60 years ago. The connection between Mahatma Gandhi and this fine university is among the early bonds of partnership between our two great nations\nIt also echoes the value that our two societies place in having a strong education system for our national growth.\nWe have a ancient Indian saying:\nVyaye Krate Eva Nitya, Vidya Dhan Sob Dhan Pramanam\nMeans: The wealth that increases by giving, that wealth is\nI am sure you also have a Swahili proverb:\n\"Pesa, kam matumizi yake, huisha; kujifunza, kam matumizi yake, huongezeka\",\nThat is, money if you use it, comes to an end; But, learning if you use it, increases\nFriends,\nKenya is a young country in a ancient continent.

Not just in the political sphere, but also in economic, social and developmental fields\nAnd, at some levels\nAlready, we trade with each other With significant presence of Indian companies in Kenya, our investment partnership is strong, diverse and vibrant.\nThis, in turn, creates jobs for the young and educated in both our societies.
