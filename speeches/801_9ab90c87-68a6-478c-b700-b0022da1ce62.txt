And, you are a inspiration to many here and in India\nThank you, Mohan, Venkie, Ambassador\nIt is a great pleasure to be here For me, this is a special event, because the idea of ​​startups is close to my heart.\nYou are likely to wonder why, because governments and national capitals are supposed to stop or slow things down, not start them up\nI know this was the view of Washington from Silicon Valley; And, this is exactly how tech specialists in Bengaluru thought about New Delhi.\nAnd, I know that the only problems that have not been solved are the ones\nWhen I shifted to Delhi last year, I thought of my government as a startup So, I also saw some of the bumps you face on the road.\nI understand your challenges\nThe course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination, inspiration, invention and innovation.\nI often say, if there is a strong wind blowing Others will want to put a windmill or launch their seals on the seas.\nThe difference between perception of something as a challenge or an opportunity is the difference between inertia and initiative; status quo and progress\nThe idea of ​​start ups is as ancient as the world. Every economic year has defined by the disruption of the previous one, by the evolution of ideas and products that displace the old ones.\nStart Ups The mega corporations of today were Startsup of yesterday.\nWhat is different now is the digital age that has created a fertile new environment for Startups.\nThis is a world where you do not get rich resources, but by spreading an idea. More than the creator, who discovers applications\nToday, the Startups defy the natural rates of growth. An idea can become a global name within a year. Customers can multiply at the rate of millions, employees at the rate of billionaires.\nThe convergence of technology, integration across diverse fields, distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea, has opened a new world for enterprise.\nThe Ecosystem was born in the Silicon Valley. No community is shaping our world as much as the Californian Coast.\nIt is not just big names, but small companies that are fashioning every day new ways to enrich the life of artists and creators.\nThat underlines America's success and inspires the world.\nSo, I see Startups, technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for India's transformation, and for jobs.\nWe are a nation of 800 million youth below the age of 35 years. They are eager for change; have the power and drive to pursue it; And, the confidence to achieve it\nWhen six hundred businesses are producing six small businesses, on a regular basis, we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country.\nIndia's own ecosystem of startups is evolving rapidly. It is driven by the energy, enterprise and innovation of our youth.\nWe have a huge market with rapid growth and untapped opportunities in every sector. We now have the institutions, incentives and interest for new ventures. We have incubators, accelerators and investors willing to back an idea and assume risks.\nIndia has got the potential of Startup Ventures with great enthusiasm and energy. In the past few years, they have grown exponentially.\nWe have a outstanding group of startups from India. They are applying technology to transform healthcare, education, agriculture, clean energy, security, financial inclusion of the poor and access to clean water.\nOur Startups represent not just commercial success stories, but are powerful examples of social innovation.\nThe pace at which people in India are taking into digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income\nThere are about a billion people with mobile phones in India; smart phones and internet users are hundred millions, growing at high double digits.\nThe scale of India's development needs is huge And, the need to achieve it is urgent\nYou can not just continue on the traditional paths.\nThis is the vision and the spirit behind Digital India, which has spoken about last night: to use technology to transform governance, empower our citizens, eliminate obstacles to opportunities, deepen social change, improve scale and speed to development, improve delivery services, design affordable products for the poor, customize services for specific groups, and build a more sustainable future for our planet.\nStartups will have an important role in achieving our vision.\nFrom making infrastructure to providing services, from manufacturing of products to human resources development, from supporting governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, Digital India is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you.\nI see Startups, but as long term commitments\nOur application and enterprise are limited only by our imagination.\nWe have today our department of space that provides free data on its portal. In the course of past few months, we have put together 170 applications of space technology in governance and development.\nMany of them could become the new ventures in India.\nBut, it is not just about the opportunities generated on the digital platform and advanced science by urban enterprises.\nI want to see the idea and the spirit of startups, light up the economies and the fortune of people in rural India. From handicrafts to tourism, the frontiers of possibilities and the scale of reach in India is immense.\nI want to do this specially for women, who have shown the marvelous success in enterprise, whenever they have had opportunities They transform not only our rural economy, but also our society\nOur Development Model is a public sector and private sector. I speak of a third sector, Personal Sector, of individual enterprises, micro enterprises and micro finance\nThat is why I focused on Startup India in the Independence Day Address this year.\nWe are launching our mission And, I assure you that they will not be your government.\nOne is the Atal Innovation Mission, after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji to promote innovation.\nAnother is SETU, which means bridge in hindi - Self Employment \u0026 Talent Utilization (SETU). This will be an incubation and facilitation program.\nWe are also setting up Electronics Development Fund to support design, development and launch of new products.\nWe are reforming our regulations and processes, and making it easy to start and do business in India.\nWe are making our digital infrastructure and services accessible and affordable that will also bring broadband to six hundred thousand villages, and free Wi-Fi schools, universities and public places.\nWe are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.\nSo, Make in India, Skill India and Design India will create a surge of opportunities.\nSo, friends, as we thought of startingups, it was natural to choose Silicon Valley for our first overseas event.\nFor, India and the United States have a natural partnership of innovation and technology that has shaped the knowledge economy.\nI am told that Indians account for 15% of startups Hundreds of thousands of Indian professionals here and in India are contributing to the global success of the U.S. enterprises Many are leading today\nOur universities, labs and companies are working for next generation of advanced bio fuels, solar energy and energy efficiency.\nYoung Stanford scholars are teaming up with Indian counterparts in Delhi to make affordable biomedical devices for rural India MIT Tata Center's Khethworks is changing the lives of small farmers with solar-based irrigation systems.\nWe have here with us Manu Prakash, a young Indian scientist in Stanford, who has a lab for his name at the university.\nThis is the power of our cooperation and cooperation. Sitting here, you can touch the life of a young child in a remote village.\nI also hope that a young girl in a small town in India will look at the exhibitors today and dream of her own project. And, someone in Mumbai or the Bay Area will be the angel to her dreams.\nThis is the possibility of the digital bridge - to connect remote life and change fortunes and future.\nThis is the potential of youth and innovation.\nIt can also be a partnership between India and the United States, which will prosper in our countries and our strategic partnership.\nIt can enable us to lead the digital century and find solutions to enduring human problems and emerging global challenges.\nI am happy to see so many new partnerships today\nI am honored to launch the BHARAT Fund today - which stands not only for India, but also for Better Health, Agricultural, Renewable and Technologies.\nI am happy that Qualcomm has announced a fund of USD 150 million for Startups in India. I want to than tiE for its valuable suggestions for creating a more supportive environment for startups\nI know you will succeed But, when you need a help hand, or when you find hurdles in your way, we will be there for you\nLet me thank NASSCOM, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and TiE Silicon Valley for this very special event.\nI am confident that you have inspired many young talents in India, launched thousands new dreams, and sown the seeds of many India-U.S. partnerships\nThank you."
