Even though this is my first visit to this great country, my delegation and I already feel at home in the Rainbow Nation. For this, Excellency, we are deeply gratefulto you For me personally, this visit is a chance to pay homage to the greatest human souls to have ever walked the Earth - Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela\nFriends,\nThrough centuries, India and South Africa have nurtured strong people to people ties.We stand together in our common fight against racial subjugation and colonialism. It is South Africa in that Gandhound is his true calling. He is much like India as much as South Africa.\nFriends,\nOur shared values, suffering and struggles provide a strong foundation to our strategic partnership And, its success is visible in a range of sectors.In our discussions today, President Zuma and I reviewed the full spectrum of our engagement.We agree that in the last two decades, our relationship is strong advances and concrete achievements of a story. Two way trade has grown over 300 percent in last ten years. Indian companies hold strong business interests in South Africa About one fourth of our investments in Africa\nAnd, there is potential to expand our business and investment ties, especially in the areas of:\nMinerals and mining;\nhigh-technology manufacturing; and\ninformation and communication technology\nI am convinced that industry to industry ties can not only bring rich economic gains to our societies. They can give a new shape to our partnership, and drive it to new levels.And, in the process, also help our both countries more robust regional and global role.Later today, the President and I will sit down with the business leadership of the two countries to recognize synergies in our engagement.\nFriends,\nThe nature of our developing economies demands that our engagement should focus on our human capital. Our capacities and needs in the fields of vocational, technical and professional education complement each other, and can benefit both our people India is also ready to share it's expertise and capacities for the development of small and medium business in South Africa. Beyond economic ties, and links to business, trade and investment, we can also partner in the field of defense and security. Both, at the level of industry and for our strategic and security needs In India, this is one of the sectors witnessing a complete transformation. It offers exciting opportunities in defense Our companies can also pool their capacities to jointly develop or manufacture defence equipments and platforms. And, not just to meet our defense needs, but also to respond to regional and global demand.\nFriends,\nPresident Zuma and I also agreed on the need to work more closely on international issues and emerging global challenges. I thanked the President for South Africa's support to India's membership of the Atomic Suppliers Group. We know that we can actively support our friends, like South Africa. Climate change, and its impact on the world, is our shared concern We agreed that a large scale effort and focus is on renewable energy. It was done in mind that India had led the efforts to form a International Solar Alliance at COP 21 in Paris. I believe that it is the most effective platform for access to knowledge, technology and finance for promoting solar energy. I am thankful to President Zuma, for South Africa's partnership in this alliance, which has already been supported by over 120 countries. Terrorism is another shared threat that puts people at risk. It attacks our society The President and I agree that our two nations need to stay vigilant and cooperate actively to combat terrorism, both in our region and in the world\nFriends,\nThe waters of the Indian Ocean are our common sea frontiers. And, The Indian Ocean Rim Association has emerged as a key platform of engagement for the marine neighbours connected by the Indian Ocean. I welcome South Africa's chairmanship of the organization for 2017-19 India and South Africa are also working in the future through IBSA [India, Brazil and South Africa] and BRICS. I look forward to welcoming President Zuma in Goa for the BRICS Summit later this year, in October.\nFriends,\nLet me say this in the end:\nFrom the Satyagraha of Gandhi to the forgiveness of Madiba;\nFrom ports of Gujarat to the shores of Durban;\nUnited by our shared values ​​and common struggles;\nIn the vast opportunities of our oceans and economies; and\nthrough the spirit of Vasudaiva Kutumbakum and Ubuntu.\nOur relationship has been a story of resolve, determination, justice and the excellence of human endeavor. It is truly exceptional and unlike any other\nThank you,\nThank you very much\nThis visit is a opportunity to pay homage to two great human souls - Mahatma Gandhi \u0026 Nelson Mandela: PM @narendramodi @NellonMandela\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) July 8, 2016\nStood together in our common fight against colonialism and racial subjugation: PM @narendramodi on India-SA ties @PresidencyZA @SAPresident\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) July 8, 2016\nIn the last two decades our ties are a story of strong advances and concrete achievements: PM @narendramodi at the joint press meet\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) July 8, 2016\nThe Prime Minister is speaking about growing economic and trade ties between India and South Africa.
