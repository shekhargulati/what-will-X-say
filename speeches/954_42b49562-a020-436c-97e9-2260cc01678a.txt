"My ministerial co-workers, Distinguished participants and guests\nI am happy to participate in 10th edition of Aero India\nMore than 250 Indian companies and more than 300 foreign firms are here\nThere are defense ministers, senior officials and hundreds of business leaders from around the world.\nA big welcome to each of you!\nThis is the biggest ever Aero India This reflects a new level of confidence within our country and global interest in India.\nTo many of you, India is a major business opportunity.\nWe are the reputation of being the largest importer of the world.\nThat may be some music But, this is one area where you will not like to be number one!\nOur security challenges are well known Our international responsibilities are evident We do need to increase our defense Do we have to modernize our defense forces\nWe have the ability of the future, where technology will play a major role.\nAs a nation of one billion people, we also have huge requirements for managing internal security.\nWe are increasingly integrating\nThese opportunities make Aero India an important international event.\nFor me, this is not just a trade fair for defense equipment.\nThis is a great meeting of one of the largest global supply chains.\nAnd, a platform to launch India`s defence manufacturing sector\nA nation with a strong defense industry will not only be more secure\nIt will also reap rich economic benefits\nIt can boost investment, expand manufacturing, support enterprise, and increase economic growth in the country.\nIn India, the defense industry in the government sector alone employs nearly 200,000 workers and thousands of engineers and scientists They produce an output of almost 7 billion dollars annually. It also supports a very large pool of small and medium enterprises.\nOur business is still in small But, it already employs thousands of people\nThis is the fact that almost 60% of our defense equipment is to be imported.\nAnd, we are spending ten of dollars on acquisitions from abroad.\nThere are studies that show that even a 20 to 25% reduction in imports could directly create an additional 100,000 to 120,000 highly skilled jobs in India.\nIf we could raise the percentage of domestic procurement from 40% to 70% in the next five years, we would double the output in our defense industry.\nImagine the impact in terms of jobs and services!\nThink of the spin off benefits on other sectors in advanced materials and technologies!\nThat's why we are focusing on developing India's Defense industry with an understanding of mission.\nThis is why it is the heart of our Make in India program.\nWe are reforming our defense procurement policies and procedures. There will be a clear preference for equipment manufactured in India.\nOur procurement procedures will ensure simplicity, accountability and speedy decision making.\nWe have raised the permitted level of Foreign Direct Investment to 49% This can go higher, if the project brings state-of-the-art technology\nWe have allowed investments up to 24% by Foreign Institutional Investments And, there is no need to be a single Indian investor with at least a 51% stake.\nIndustrial licensing requirements Where is it needed?\nWe are expanding the role of private sector, even for major platforms. Our goal is to provide a level playing field for all.\nWe speak in terms of national capacity, not public sector or private sector\nOffsets system is a critical instrument to develop and upgrade our defense industry.\nWe have introduced significant reforms in our offsets policy. I am aware that it still needs a lot of improvements. We will continue pursuing them in domestic industry and our foreign partners.\nI want our offsets policy not as a means to export low-end products, but to acquire state-of-the-art technologies and skills in core areas of priority.\nGovernment's support is for research and development And, it should be\nWe are introducing a scheme to provide 80% of funding from the government. And, we are also launching a Technology Development Fund.\nFor too long, our research and development has been confined to government laboratories. We must include our scientists, soldiers, academia, industry and independent experts in more detail.\nLast month on the Army Day Reception, I had asked to meet our officers and soldiers, who made the best innovations in our defense equipment. I saw you\nFinally, we have made our exports policies clearer, simpler and predictable. But, we will also abide by the highest standards of export controls and international responsibility.\nWe will expand our exports, but we will ensure that our equipment and technology do not fall into the wrong hands.\nIndia's record in this area has been impeccable and it will remain so.\nI am happy with our policies\nIndian private corporations have responded with enthusiasm There is new excitement in our small and medium scale sector. Many of the biggest global firms are forming strategic partnerships in India\nSome of them have already started using India as part of their global supply chains or engineering services.\nIn September 2014 Dynamatic Technologies and its partner Boeing inaugurated a plant in India to manufacture critical parts for a Boeing Helicopter that is sold worldwide. I understand that it was a day after\nI am happy to learn\nBut, we still need to do more\nWe have further improved our acquisition and approval processes. We want to be a clear roadmap of our future needs\nThis must take in account not only new technology trends, but also the nature of future challenges.\nWe must pay attention to developing supply chains, with emphasis on innovation.\nWe must bridge between the prototype development and quality of production.\nWe must develop a financing system It is a market where buyers are mainly government\nWe should also ensure that our tax system does not discriminate against domestic sales in comparison to imports.\nMore broadly, our defense industry will succeed more if we can change the manufacturing sector in India\nWe need great infrastructure, sound business climate, clear investment policies, ease of doing business, and easy access to inputs.\nWe need a national industry that produces advanced materials, the most sophisticated electronics and the best engineering products.\nOver the last eight months, we have worked hard\nAbove all, we need a vast pool of highly skilled and qualified human resources for the defense industry.\nOur aerospace industry alone needs about 200,000 people in another ten years.\nWe will set up special universities and skill development centers, just as we have done in atomic energy and space.\nI have specially invited the State Government\nDistinguished guests,\nThis is a new era for the defense industry in India.\nIt will not be possible We have been doing this past, without absorbing any technology or developing our own capabilities. In some areas, we are three decades ago.\nFrankly, our public sector needs to do better now We have exploited our huge assets and a vast potential. At the same time, we have to make them accountable\nWe want to develop It should be continuously at the cutting edge of the global industry.\nI am confident that India will emerge as a major global center for defense industries.\nWe have the basic building blocks for India; and, a large nation requirement.\nWe will build an industry that will have room for everyone - public sector, private sector and foreign companies\nFrom sellers, foreign companies must turn into strategic partners.\nWe need their technology, skills, systems integration and manufacturing strength\nThe nature of industry is such that import will always be there\nIn turn, they can use India as part of their global supply chain.\nDefense budgets around the world India's frugal but sophisticated manufacturing and engineering service sectors can help reduce costs\nIndia can also be a base for export to third countries, especially because of India's growing defense partnerships in Asia and beyond.\nA strong Indian defense industry will not only make India more secure It will make India more prosperous\nAero India can be a catalyst in realizing our goals. That is why I am here today.\nSo, as we look at these wonderful aircraft and enjoy the amazing fly pasts, I also hope we can get some business done.\nAnd, sow the seeds of successful new ventures and partnerships - to give our citizens new opportunities, and the world more stable and peaceful\nThank you."
