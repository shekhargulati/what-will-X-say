We will all now implement our commitments\nTo stimulate growth, we need to increase public investment, not just rely on monetary policy.\nG20's continuous call to Central Bank for monetary policy\nMultilateral Development Banks should enlarge their capital base to support infrastructure needs of developing countries. New institutions such as the New Development Bank are welcome additional sources of financing.\nThere is a global consensus on the climate change. However, multilateral institutions should not impose such difficult safeguards and conditions on loans that they become the barrier to development in many countries and undermine sustainable development.\nG20 efforts must be committed to the UN sustainable development goals, adopted this year, especially with the number one goal of elimination of all poverty by 2030.\nWe welcome the G20 focus on women and, on youth this year.\nStable long term global economic growth requires not only capital flows, but also efforts to facilitate labor mobility and skill portability.\nExcellencies,\nIndia's economic growth is expected to grow 7.5% this year and achieve a growth rate of 8% plus next year. We have reduced inflation and current account and fiscal deficit\nOur programs of inclusive development, including financial inclusion, universal access to basic needs by target year, Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Industrial Corridors and Smart Cities will boost growth and employment in India.\nThis will be a source of strength\nThank you!"
