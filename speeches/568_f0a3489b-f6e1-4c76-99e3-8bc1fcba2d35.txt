So, it is a special pleasure to receive the festive season.\nFriends,\nPrime Minister Key and I have met many times on the sidelines of multilateral summits and today, it is an honor for us to welcome a bilateral visit.\nIn a little while from now, our cricket teams will take the field in Ranchi for the fourth One Day International. In many ways, some of the cricketing terminology reflects progress in our bilateral linkages.\nIn our ties, we have moved from fielding at Long Off to taking a new guard at the batting pitch. Defensive play has given way to aggressive batting\nFriends,\nPrime Minister Key and I have had detailed and productive discussions on all aspects of our bilateral engagement and multilateral cooperation.\nTrade and Investment ties have been one of the key areas of our conversation. We both recognized the need for greater economic engagement in order to effectively respond to the growing uncertainties in global economy and, agreeing that expanding business and commercial ties should be one of the priority items of our partnership. I am sure that the big business delegation accompanying Prime Minister Key will only witness firsthand the investment opportunities in India's growth story. Their interactions will also build new commercial partnerships I would like to mention food processing, dairy and agriculture, and related areas in their supply chain. New Zealand's strength and capacity in these sectors can be combined with India's vast technology needs to build partnerships that can benefit both our societies\nWe also agree that both governments should also promote greater business connectivity, including through the movement of skilled professionals, between our two economies and societies. In this regard, we have agreed to continue our work in a balanced and mutually beneficial Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement.\nFriends,\nAlong side extensive bilateral engagement, our close cooperation also extends to the global arena. On Regional issues, we have agreed to enhance our cooperation, including the East Asia Summit process. The reform of international governance organizations is a shared priority for us both. We are thankful for New Zealand's support to India joining a reformed UN Security Council as a permanent member. As we make our own contribution to the developmental efforts of the Pacific Island countries, we will continue to contact closely with New Zealand to complement and supplement each other's efforts.\nI am also thankful to Prime Minister Key for New Zealand's constructive approach to the consideration of India's Nuclear Suppliers Group.\nFriends,\nTerrorism remains one of the biggest challenges to global peace and security. Today, the financial, logistical and information networks of terror span the entire globe. The barriers of geography do not protect guardianization and terrorism. Nations who believe in human rights\nPrime Minister Key and I have agreed to strengthen our security and intelligence cooperation against terrorism and radicalization, including in the domain of cyber security\nExcellency,\nThe people of New Zealand have expressed their confidence in your leadership time and again and, I can see why\nI thank you, for your personal commitment to your personal partner, and to strengthen the bonds of friendship.\nOnce again, I extend a warm welcome to you and your delegation, and wish to be a productive and successful visit to India.\nThank you.\nThank you very much\nPrime Minister Key \u0026 I have had detailed and productive discussions on all aspects of our bilateral engagement \u0026 multilateral cooperation: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 26, 2016\nWe both recognize the need for greater economic engagement in order to effectively respond to the growing uncertainties in global economy: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 26, 2016\nFood processing, dairy and agriculture and related areas in their supply chain are some of the areas of special potential for cooperation: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 26, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: We have agreed to continue work on a sustainable and mutually beneficial CECA pic.twitter.com/ngsCg7KOk5\n- Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) October 26, 2016\nPM and I agree to strengthen security \u0026 intelligence cooperation against terror \u0026 radicalization including in cyber security: PM\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) October 26, 2016\nPM @narendramodi: We are thankful for New Zealand's support to joining a reformed UN Security Council as a permanent member"
