"PM Modi speaks at the Workshop of Agriculture Cooperation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan\nInternational partnerships can be catalysts for the development of agriculture: PM Modi\nIndia-Tajikistan partnership is promoting peace \u0026 stability, development \u0026 prosperity in the whole region: PM\nHis Excellency President Rahmon,\nOfficials and Experts from India and Tajikistan\nAnd distinguished guests\nI am truly happy to visit Tajikistan.\nWe have links of history, the proximity of geography, the unity of spirit and harmony of our hopes. Above all, we have very goodwill between our people\nThis is a very special event. It is one of the most important that I have attended in the Middle East\nI have travelled to many countries around the world. Wherever I have been, there is usually an event of trade, manufacturing or finance.\nThis is the first time we have a joint event on agriculture, especially on a scale as large as this.\nMr. President, thank you for this workshop. It's a vision for Tajikistan's development.\nAs in the world of business, international partnerships can also be catalysts for the development of agriculture. India's own Green Revolution is a visual and successful proof of that.\nIt should be natural for India and Tajikistan to collaborate in agriculture, live stocks and dairy.\nWe share many similar natural features We are defined by mountains, rivers, sharp turns in seasons and fertility of soil.\nWe are the people\nWe both have shortage of cultivable land related to our needs,\nI know that with less than ten percent of area as land fit for cultivation, Tajikistan faces this constraint more than we do\nWe both have pockets of abundance of freshwater, but we have both faced the challenge of managing our irrigation.\nNow we all face the impact of our agriculture.\nWe can understand some of the problems that Tajikistan is facing today, because we have gone through that path ourselves\nSo, our solutions and our experiences may be more relevant to Tajikistan, perhaps, what more advanced nations may have to offer.\nThat is why our cooperation can be more fruitful for Tajikistan\nAfter we gained independence in 1947, our journey in the agricultural sector has been remarkable. We faced many challenges - from small farms and low productivity to inadequate irrigation and infrastructure.\nToday, we are self-sufficient in food grains and one of the major exporters of farm produce and animal products.\nWe are the world's largest producer of milk, one of the top producers of fruits and vegetables and one of the three leading producers of fisheries.\nAlong the way, we have created a resource base that will be of great value to our friends in Tajikistan.\nWe have world class organizations of research and training in agriculture, under dairy and live-stocks under every possible climate condition.\nWe have developed farming techniques and farm equipment that are affordable and effective.\nWe have created the most successful cooperative movement in dairy and one of the best dairy processing industries in the world.\nWe have good seeds and processing technology and equipment. Some of these may be useful for cotton farming And, we have done well with micro irrigation systems\nWe do have a lot of challenges in agriculture in India. And, with the ancient creed of \"Ananda Dukhi Bhav\" - may the provider of food be happy - we have launched many new initiatives to make our farms yield more and our farmers more prosperous.\nAnd, they come from the field of water. from access to markets to covering risks; from providing infrastructure to developing new technologies\nNothing will give us more joy than the opportunity to share our friends.\nIt comes from our ancient belief that we enrich ourselves while we share our fruits It is a principle that also defines the great people of Tajikistan.\nSo, we will be happy to open your doors to our scientists and experts.\nWe can help in growing the range of crops you produce and the number of crops you get in a year. Greenhouse cultivation is a process that will be suitable for Tajikistan.\nWe can collaborate in developing hybrids of cotton and wheat, two of your most important crops, so that they produce more and have greater resilience. This will reduce risks.\nWe can share our experience in contract farming and developing the dairy industry, including dairy processing plants. Indeed, for Tajikistan, dairy and live stock hold great potential to make up for the constraints of land.\nAs part of our development partnership, we can explore credit support for supply and post-harvest processing equipment to Tajikistan.\nWe can work in water conservation and micro-irrigation, and in the improvement of the farm soil here. In India, we have launched a soil health card, just as the farmer may have his own health card\nWe are the best way to help\nWe have shared much like each other through the ages, including fruits and vegetables and our cuisines.\nToday, the possibilities of cooperation are endless Realizing them is important\nIndia and Tajikistan are strategic partners. This is one of our closest and most important relationships\nOurs is a shared enterprise of promoting development and prosperity in our two countries. It is also a partnership for promoting peace and stability in the region.\nWe can not achieve prosperity\nThat is how we can create a strong and stable society that can withstand the turmoil of our times and contribute to regional peace and stability.\nSo, our cooperation in agriculture is central to the shared vision and aspirations of India and Tajikistan.\nToday I complete my tour of Central Asia. I\nreturn to India convinced that India and Central Asia should reconnect It is important for the future\nSo, we will improve our surface connectivity, as well as our digital and air connectivity. We will reach you through Iran and other Central Asian countries.\nBut, I also hope that India and Tajikistan can connect directly.\nBecause, that will not only be the most natural way to trade, it will bring benefits\nHowever, even as we build our connectivity, we will not wait.\nWe will deepen our cooperation in agriculture and transform our relationship into human endeavor.\nBecause, the more you will be able to become more successful and our relationship will become more and more robust.\nThat is why this event is so important for me\nIt reinforces my belief in the strength of India-Tajikistan relations and confidence in our strategic partnership.\nI wish you all great success I thank the participant I thank you, Mr. President, for your presence and your leadership\nThank you, very much"
