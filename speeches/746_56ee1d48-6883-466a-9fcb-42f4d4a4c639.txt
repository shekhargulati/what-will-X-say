"Thank you for the honor and privilege of delivering the Singapore Lecture.\n\nI am conscious that I walk in the footsteps of leaders who have shaped modern India and our relationship with this region -President Shri APJ Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Shri P.V. Narsimha Rao, and former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nMr. Prime Minister, I am deeply honoured that you have joined us here.\nWe have been on the road in the past few weeks - for the G20 and the Asiaan and East Asia Summits.\nThis tells you how many people are\nTo the people of Singapore, on 50 years of Independence, I extend the greetings and the wishes of 1.25 billion friends and admirers.\nIn the life of humans and nations, milestones of time are natural\nBut, few countries can celebrate the first fifty years of existence with a sense of pride and satisfaction that Singapore deserves to.\nAnd, I can do no better than to begin with the homage to the tallest leaders of our time and the architect of modern Singapore - Lee Kuan Yew.\nTo capture his mission in his words, he gave a successful Singapore look.\nAnd, it was his well known steely determination that he saw Singapore through to his golden jubilee year.\nHis influence was global And, in him, India had a well wisher, who has spoken with the honesty of true friendship He believed in India's potential at home and his role abroad\nFor me, he has a personal inspiration. From his Singapore Stories, I drew many lessons.\nThe most profound, yet simple, idea was that transformation of a nation begins with a change in the way we are. And, that is why it has been built as modern infrastructure.\nFor me, too, in India, the Swachh Bharat campaign is not just a program, but it is a way to think, live and work.\nFor quality, efficiency, and productivity are not just technical measures, but also a state of mind and a way of life.\nSo, in my visit to Singapore this March and in the observance of a day's mourning in India, we wanted to honor a true friend and a very special relationship.\nSingapore is a nation that has become a metaphor for the reality of dreams.\nSingapore teaches us many things\nThe size of a nation is no barrier to the scale of its achievements.\nAnd, the lack of resources is no constraint for inspiration, imagination, and innovation.\nWhen a nation embraces diversity, it can unite behind a common purpose.\nAnd, international leadership flows from the power of thought, not just the orthodox measures of strength\nSingapore has done more than just a nation in the highest levels of prosperity within a generation.\nIt has been inspired by this area's progress and led in its integration.\nAnd, it has made others believe that the progress of our horizons, not an unseen and distant hope.\nSingapore's success flows not from the aggregate of numbers\nIt is based on what I believe is the key to success: the quality of human resources, the belief of a people\nDistinguished members of the audience,\nIt is the same vision that we are pursuing the transformation of India.\nPeople are our efforts; And, they will be the power behind change\nI do not judge the success of our efforts, but from the warm glow of smile on human faces.\nSo, one of our policies\nThe other set to create the conditions in which enterprise flourishes, opportunities expand and our citizens are unlocked.\nSo, we are investing in our schools. Special focus on the girl child; financial inclusion; sustainable habitats; clean rivers and smart cities; And, access to basic needs of our citizens - from water and sanitation to power and housing\nWe will nurture and defend an environment in which every citizen belongs and participates, his rights and confidence about his opportunities.\nAnd, we are making opportunities by reforming our laws, regulations, policies, processes and institutions; by the self and the government\nTogether with this software of change, we are also building the hardware of progress - next generation infrastructure, revived manufacturing, improved agricultural, easy trade and smarter services.\nThat is why we are moving on many fronts at the same time, aware of the linkages that make a comprehensive strategy.\nI learned long ago that Singaporeans are very well informed about India to be burdened with numbers, a visitor, even from India\nIn any case, for me, the emergence of India as the fastest growing major economy in the world is less important than the enduring: the wheels of change are moving; confidence is growing; resolve is strong; and, the direction is clear\nAnd, it is spreading across the nation, as the most distant village and the farthest citizen is the mainstream of national economy.\nDistinguished guests,\nIndia and Singapore have been on many crossroads of time.\nOur relationship is written in the pages of history, the footprints of culture, the ties of kinship and the old connection of commerce.\nWe stood together in friendship; And, we reached out to each other\nSingapore's success has become an aspiration of Indians And, in turn, India became a more peaceful, balanced and stable world\nAs India opened itself, Singapore became India's springboard to the world and the gateway to the East.\nNo one works hard for it and no one deserves more credit for it than Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong He re-connected India to Singapore and the region\nHe also opened my eyes to its vast prospects.\nToday, Singapore is one of our most important partners in the world. It is a relationship that is wide-ranging\nWe have extensive defense and security relations. It flows out of shared interests and a common vision. Singapore holds regular exercises with and in India\nSingapore is the largest investment destination and destination in India; the world's most connected nation to India; the largest trading partner in Southeast Asia; And, a popular destination for tourists and students\nNow, as we build the India of our dreams, Singapore is already a major partner in that enterprise: world class human resources, smart cities, clean rivers, clean energy, or next generation sustainable infrastructure.\nStarting from the first IT Park in Bengaluru, it now includes the newest state capital in India, Amravati in Andhra Pradesh.\nOur partnership will expand as our economies grow and the framework of trade and investment improves further.\nBut, I have always seen Singapore in loftier terms\nSingapore's success in overcoming odds leads me to seek a partnership that addresses the challenges of 21st century - from food and water to clean energy and sustainable habitats\nAnd, in many ways, Singapore will also influence the century.\nMr. Prime Minister, Distinguished members,\nThis area covers the arc of Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Regions. Though we choose to define it, the underlining theme of connected histories and interconnected destinies stand out clearly.\nThis is a region of expanding freedom and prosperity. It is home to two of the most populous nations; some of the world's largest economies; And, the world's most talented and hard working people\nAsia's re-emergence is the greatest phenomenon of our era.\nFrom the dark of the last century, Japan led Asia's rise It then extended to Southeast Asia, Korea and China.\nAnd, India is now the bright hope for sustaining Asian dynamism and prosperity.\nBut, this is also a region with many unsettled questions and unresolved disputes; of competing claims and contested norms; of expanding military power and extending shadow of terrorism; and, uncertainties on seas and vulnerability in cyber space.\nThe region is not a island in a vast ocean, but deeply connected and influenced by the world beyond\nWe are also a region of disparities within and between states; where the challenges of habitats, food and water stay; where our gifts of nature and wealth of traditions feel the pressure of rapid progress; And, our agriculture and islands are threatened by climate change.\nAsia has seen some of its points But, it has probably never been here before And, Asia is still finding a path through its multiple transitions to a peaceful, stable and prosperous future.\nIt is a journey that will succeed\nAnd, Singapore and India should work together to realize it.\nIndia's history has been incredibly from Asia\nThere were times when we turned in\nAnd now, as we reintegrate more closely with Asia, we are returning to history. We are retracing our ancient maritime and land routes.\nAnd, in the course of last eighteen months, my government has more than this region\nFrom a new opening with Pacific Island Nations, Australia and Mongolia to more intense engagement with China, Japan, Korea and ASEAN members, we have pursued our vision with purpose and vigour.\nIndia and China share a boundary and five millennia of continuous engagement. Monks and merchants have nurtured our ties and enriched our societies.\nIt's a history reflected in the seventh century tour of XuanZang that I have had the privilege of connecting, from my birthplace in Gujarat to Xian in China, where President Xi hosted me this May.\nWe see it in religious texts written in Sanskrit, Pali, and Chinese; In the letters of the past, exchanged with warmth and grace; in India's famous tanchoi sarees; and, in Cinapatta, the Sanskrit name for silk.\nToday, we constitute two-fifths of humanity and two of the world's fastest growing major economies. China's Economic Transformation\nAnd, as it rebalances its economy, and as India steps up its pace of growth, we can both reinforce each other's progress. And, we can stay in our region\nAnd, together, we can be more effective in addressing our common global challenges, from trade to climate change.\nWe have unresolved issues, including our boundary question, but we've been able to keep our border region peaceful and stable. And, we have been able to strengthen strategic communication and expand convergences. We explore shared economic opportunities while addressing common threats like terrorism.\nIndia and China will engage constructively across the complexity of their relations as two self-assured and confident nations, aware of their interests and responsibilities.\nJust as China's rise has driven the global economy, the world looks forward to China's advance global and regional peace and stability.\nIndia and Japan may have discovered some other later. But, my friend, Prime Minister Abe, showed me the magnificent shrines of the Kyoto, the symbols of our much longer spiritual engagement.\nAnd, more than a hundred years ago, as Swami Vivekananda reached the shores of Japan, he urged the Indian youth to go east to Japan.\nIndependent India took that advice seriously. There are few partnerships that enjoy so much goodwill in India.\nNo nation has contributed so much to India's modernization and progress Japan - cars, metros and industrial parks, for example And, no partner is likely to play as big a role in India's transformation as Japan.\nWe do more together now We see this as a strategic partnership that is vital for securing a peaceful and stable Asia, Pacific and Indian Ocean Regions.\nWith Korea and Australia, our relationships have started with strong economic foundations, and have become strategic in content.\nAnd, Asian is the anchor of our Act East Policy. We are linked by geography and history, united against many common challenges and bound by many shared aspirations.\nWith each ASAN member, we have been deepening political, security, defense and economic relations. And, as the ASEAN Community leads the way to regional integration, we look forward to a more dynamic partnership between India and ASEAN that has 1.9 billion people\nWith almost the whole region, India has the frameworks of economic cooperation. We want to be more deeply integrated with the regional economy. And, we will upgrade our Partnership Agreements and work for an early conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.\nIn the flux and transition of our times, the most critical need in this region is uphold and strengthen the rules and norms that should define our collective behavior.\nThis is why we should all come together, in East Asia Summit and other forums, to build a cooperative and collaborative future, not on the strength of some, but on the consent of all\nIndia will work with countries in the region and beyond, including the United States and Russia, our East Asia Summit partners, to ensure that our commons - ocean, space and cyber - shared prosperity of avenues, not new theaters of contests.\nIndia will lend its power to safe, secure and free of all.\nThis is an age of inter-dependence when nations should come together, to realize the promise of this century. We should also do so, because our pressing challenges are not possible, but common to each of us\nTerrorism is one such major global challenge, and a force larger than individual groups. its shadow stretches across our societies and our nations, both in recruitment and choice of targets It does not just take a toll of life, but can derail economies.\nThe world should speak in voice and act in unison. There will be political, legal, military and intelligence efforts But, we should do more\nCountries also must be held accountable for sanctuaries, support, arms and funds\nNations must cooperate more with each other Societies must reach out and to each other We must delink terrorism from religion, and assert the human values ​​that define every faith.\nWe are a few days away from Paris, where we must achieve concrete outcome, in accordance with the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is especially important for our region, especially the small island states.\nFriends,\nOurs is a region of enormous promise. But, we know that enduring peace and prosperity are not inevitable\nSo, we must work hard to realize our vision of an Asian Century.\nAsia has the wisdom of its ancient cultures and all the great religions of the world. It also has the energy and drive of youth\nAs Asia's first Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore predicted a region to reach around this region almost a century ago, Asia is reining its self-consciousness for realization of its own self.\nHere in Singapore, where the region's currents merge; its diversity converges; ideas meet; And, aspirations gather wings, I feel that ever before\nAnd as India pursues its transformation and strives for a peaceful and stable world, Singapore will be a major partner on that journey.\nThank you."
