These mountains of Uttarakhand spontaneously inspire us for Yoga and Ayurveda.\nEven a common man gets a unique diving feeling There is an incredible spirit, and vibrations in this holy land.\nFriends,\nIt's a matter of pride for all Indians that today as the rising sun will progress on its journey, as the sunrays will reach the earth and the light is spread, those all places will be the sun with Yoga.\nFrom Dehradun to Dublin, from Shanghai to Chicago, to Jakarta to Johannesburg, everywhere, there is Yoga all around.\nWhether it is thousands of feet high mountains of Himalaya or be it desert area singed by sunlight, Yoga is flourishing the life in every situation\nWhen divisive powers gain prominence then it leads to disintegration It leads to division among the people, division among the societies and division among the countries. When there is a division in the society then it leads to the family and the person breaks from inside and tension in life continuesto grow.\nYogis helps to maintain balance between disintegration It does the job of uniting us.\nYoga brings about peace in the modern fast paced life, mind, spirit and soul.\nIt brings about peace in the family by uniting the person with the family.\nIt brings about a harmony in society\nSocieties become the links for national integration.\nAnd this kind of countries And humanity flourishes and gainstrength from this feeling of brotherhood\nIt means Yoga unites individuals, families, societies, countries and the world and it unites the whole humanity.\nWhen the proposal for Yoga Day was moved to the United Nations then it is a record in the United Nations that it was the first such motion that has been co-sponsored by the majority of countries in the world. And this was the first such proposal in the history of the United Nations which was approved in the least time. And today every citizen of the world, every country of the world thinks of Yoga as its own and it is an important message for the people of India that we are the great legacy of the inheritors, that is, that great tradition of legacy that we have preserved.\nIf we start taking pride in our legacy and if we abandon those things which are out of sync with the time, and that kind of thing does not last either However, what is worth as per the time and which is useful in making of the future, if we take pride in this kind of great legacy then the world too will never hesitate in taking pride in that But if we do not have any power in our power and capabilities then no one will accept it. If a family itself continues to demoralize a child in the family and if that family expects that the child will be respected in the locality then it is possible. When parents, when family, when brothers and sisters, all of them accept a child as it is only then the neighbors\nToday, Yoga has proved this thing that as India has once again attached itself to the power of Yoga, similarly, the world has also started attaching itself with the Yoga.\nToday, Yoga has become one of the most powerful unifying forces in the world.\nI can say it with full sense of confidence that today if we gather the people doing Yoga in the whole world then incredible facts will be revealed to the world.\nPeople gathering for Yoga, people like you gathering for Yoga in different countries, in parks, in open grounds, on the roads of the roads, in offices and homes, in hospitals, in schools and colleges, in the historical buildings, have been providing More energy to the feeling of this universal brotherhood and global friendship.\nFriends, the world has embraced Yoga and glimpses of this can be seen in the manner in which International Day of Yoga has been marked every year.\nInfact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.\nFriends, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, Yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions.\nYoga is beautiful because it is ancient yet modern ... it is constant yet evolving.\nIt is the best of our past and presentations and our future.\nIn Yoga, we have the perfect solution to the problems we face, either as individuals or in our society.\nOurs is a world that never sleeps At every given point\nA fast-paced existence I was shocked to read that every year, almost 18 million people all over the world die due to heart-related diseases. About 1.6 million people lose the fight against diabetes.\nThe way to lead a calm, creative and content life is Yoga. It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety.\nInstead of dividing, Yoga always unites\nInstead of further animosity, Yoga assimilates.\nInstead of growing suffering, Yoga heals.\nPracticing Yoga has the ability to enjoy an era of peace, happiness and brotherhood.\nMore people practicing Yoga means the world needs more people to teach it Yoga, new organizations set up, and even the technology people can connect to Yoga. I urge you all to build on this moment\nMay this Yoga Day become an opportunity to deepen our connect with Yoga and motivate people around us to practice it. This is the enduring impact of this day.\nFriends, Yoga has shown the path of wellness to the world.\nThis is the reason why the acceptance for Yoga has been increasing rapidly.\nIt has been found in the study conducted by Coventry University and Radboud University that Yoga is not only providing relief to our bodies but it also can also reverse those molecular reactions in our DNA, due to illness and depression.\nWe can protect ourselves from many diseases in addition to having a good heath if we daily practice the poses and breathing exercise of Yoga. Regular practice of Yoga has a direct bearing on the medical expenses of any family.\nIt is necessary for us to stay healthy to join in every activity, every process of the nation building and Yoga definitely has a big role in this thing too.\nSo, today, I urge you people that those who have been practicing Yoga please make it regular, and those who can not start doing Yoga so far they must make a try.\nFriends, the increasing spread of Yoga has brought the world to India and India to the world too closer. The position that Yoga has got in the world due to constant efforts made by that time.\nIt is our responsibility to further develop the understanding of Yoga for a healthy and happy humanity. Please come forward, let us further intensify our efforts.\nFrom this holy land, I once again convey my best wishes to the Yoga enthusiasts all over the world.\nI convey my sincere request to the government of Uttarakhand for this event.\nThank you very much"
