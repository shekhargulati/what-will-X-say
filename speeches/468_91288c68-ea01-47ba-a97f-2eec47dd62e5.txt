"\nDahej SEZ has made it to the top 50 industrial areas in the world: PM\nOPAL will have a key role to play in intiatives like 'Make In India' and 'Start up India': PM\nPetrochemical sector is expanding at a fast rate in the country: PM Modi\nAfter Modi's speech, PM Modi\nToday India is a bright spot in global economy: PM Modi\nLatest GDP data reveals that demonetisation did not affect India's growth: PM\nChief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupani\nAt the center my colleagues of the Cabinet Shri Nitin Gadkari and Mr. Mansukh Mandriva\nMr. Mansukh Bhai Vasava, popular MP of this area\nOther dignitaries on stage\nMy colleagues,\nOur dowry has become a small India in a way. There will be no district of the country whose people are not here and whose means of livelihood is not connected here.\nGujarat's business thinking and adventure is the buzzword of the whole country and in the world.\nDowry-Bharuch region has contributed a lot in highlighting that adventure of Gujarat.\nWhen I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, many times I came here to accelerate the development of this region and I was constantly connected to it.\nThis place I got brick by brick and step by step has seen it moving forward.\nIn the last 15 years, the Gujarat government has made significant efforts for the development of dowry. Today the result of that is that the entire area of ​​dowry has become a very important place from the industrial point of view.\nFriends, this was the result of constant efforts of the Gujarat government that Dowry-SEZ has made its place in the top 50 industrial areas of the world.\nThis was India's first such industrial area, which had recorded so much intense entry into the world racking.\nIn the year 2011-12, world ranking of dowry SEZ was 23rd.\nEven today, Dowry-SEZ places its special place in some of the world's most industrialized areas.\nDowry Industrial sector is playing a big role in not only providing employment to millions of young people of the whole country, not only in Gujarat. So far, more than 40 thousand crores investment has been invested in this area.\nI congratulate the people associated with this for the great success of Dahej-SEZ.\nThe Gujarat government has always shown seriousness in developing infrastructure in Dowry and its surroundings. For this reason, when the discussion started that there would be four petroleum-chemical-petrochemical investment areas (PCPIR) in the country, then it was named as Dahej of Gujarat.\nDue to PCPIR, more than 1.2 million people have got jobs and 32 thousand of them are those who are connected directly to it. One estimate is that when the full capacity of PCPIR will be developed, 8 lakh people will get employment in some way.\nDue to PCPIR, there has been a very good development of dowry and around Bharuch. Due to the petroleum-chemical-petrochemical investment region, there has been a massive increase in economic activities.\nToday DAJ's SEZ, PCPIR and Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation have become very vibrant industrial sites. It's like a child I've seen growing up in front of my eyes and so here I have a lot of emotional attachment too.\nDiesel SEZ and PCPIR if anybody has installed four moon, then it is ONGC PETRO ADDITIONS LIMITED i.e. Opel.\nOpel is like an anchor industry for here. It is the largest petrochemical plant in the country. It had to invest 30 thousand crore rupees, of which around 28 thousand crore has already been invested.\nCompanions, Today, per capita consumption of polymers in India is only 10 kilos whereas the average of the world is around 32 kg.\nToday, when the middle class is expanding in the whole country, the income of the people is increasing, cities are developing, surely the capita consumption of polymers will also increase.\nONGC PETRO ADDITIONS LIMITED has a big role in it. Products associated with polymers are used in many important sectors such as infrastructure, housing, packaging, irrigation, automotive, healthcare.\nOpel will be a major contributor to big projects like Central Government's Make in India and Smart City. It is estimated that by 2018, the share of OPAL in polymers will be approximately 13 percent.\nIncreasing use of polymers means that the traditional things like wood, paper, metal, their use will be less. That is, it will be helpful in saving our country's natural resources.\nPetrochemical sector in the country is growing very fast this time. Experts estimate that for the next two decades this sector will grow at a speed of 12 to 15 percent.\nFriends, in the future, this area will also develop a large scale infrastructure which includes modernization of the port, 5000 MW of power generation and waste treatment plant. Surely this will also provide employment to millions of young people of the country.\nTo facilitate the workers, the government is constantly trying to expand the job market. Efforts are being made to attract investments in industries as well as for skill development. This is being done in a planned manner for the first time in the country by making skill development ministry. The government is also expanding the job market by removing or altering the old laws.\nThe number of apprentices has been increased by improving the Apprenticeship Act and the payment received during the apprenticeship has also been increased.\nStates have been advised by making changes in the Factory Act of 1948 that they provide facilities for women to work in the night.\nApart from this, Paid Maternity Leave has been increased from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.\nEarnings and savings of workers' hard earned are deposited in the EPF account. Universal Account Number has been started to give this amount to them anywhere, anytime.\nIn certain areas where there are special possibilities for employment, such as the textile sector, there is a facility to provide employment to workers under the \"Fixed term employment\" requirement.\nStates have been advised also for the normal shops and institutions to remain open for 365 days in a year.\nCompanions, before becoming a government in 2014, what kind of economic challenges were there before the country, all of you know it. Inflation was unimpressive, both investment and investor confidence were dwindling. The direct impact of falling investment was falling on infrastructure and employment.\nBut the central government tried to solve every challenge related to the economy. While on the one hand there are fears of the whole world, India is shining as a \"bright spot\".\nLast year, in the World Investment Report, India has been ranked in the world's top 3 Prospective Host Economy between 2016 and 18.\nIn the year 2015-16, there was a record foreign investment of 55.5 billion dollars ie 3.64 lakh crore rupees. This is more than any investment done in any financial year so far.\nIn two years, India has taken up 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.\nIn the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, India was at 54th place in 2014. In 2016, India has improved its rankings, ranking 35th.\nMake in India today has become India's largest Initiative.\nAll rating agencies have praised its success. Make in India is an effort to make India a global HUB of manufacturing, design and innovation.\nToday, India is the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world due to this campaign. Whereas India was at the ninth place.\nThere has been considerable increase in the manufacturing sector. An example of this is Gross Value Addition's growth rate. Between 2012 and 2015, between 5 and 6 percent and last year it increased to 9.3 percent.\nToday India is the fastest growing country in the world's largest economies.\nPort Lead Development is the priority of the government. Work is going on at the Sagarmala plan.\nThis is an important project of modernization of ports, construction of new ports, emphasis on connectivity improvement, port-level industrialization and coastal community development.\nMore than 400 projects having investment of 8 lakh crore have been selected; And around one lakh crore projects are in different stages of implementation.\nIndian Port Rail Corporation has been established for better connectivity of railways and ports.\n14 coastal economic zones are proposed in different parts of the country.\nIn Gujarat, more than 40 projects worth Rs 85 thousand crores have been identified. Work on 5 thousand crores project has started.\nSome major plans have been launched on Kandla Port.\nThe present capacity of Kandla Port is increasing. Apart from this, smart industrial city is being developed in 1400 acres. This will be approximately 50 thousand jobs.\nWork on two new cargo jetties and one oil jetty is underway. Wind Power Project and Roof Solar Project are also being done very fast.\nAfter the decision against black money and corruption in November, the allegations of damage to the economy were being raised, the answer given by the previous quarter has given them the answer.\nThis action taken after Diwali was supported by the world's largest organizations and scholars.\nApple CEO Tim Cook said that the decision would have far-reaching consequences.\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates said that this decision would eliminate the Parelal economy and bring transparency in the economy.\nWorld Bank CEO Christina Jalierieva was also in support of this decision. He said that this will have a positive effect on the economy and what India has done, the other countries of the world will study.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak also said that this decision is very adventurous.\nThe International Monetary Fund also supported this decision.\nNobel prize-winning economist Mohammad Yunus also said that Demonetisation has left rural and unorganized sector now within the banking system.\nMartin Wolf, the chief financial commentator of Financial Times's famous news paper in Britain, wrote that this decision will bring the capital out of the hands of criminals and come to the government. And for those who have been harmed by such transfer of capital, it is difficult for them to have any kind of goodness.\nGuys, of course, when black money will be eliminated from the economy, then every sector, whether it is economic or social, everyone will have the advantage. Today the world is watching this bold decision of India with great respect.\nCompanions, in the last, I want to put one more important thing in front of you. These are environmental protection.\nI have said before, that while expanding the projects, increasing the use of new technology is also emphasizing that there is no harm to the environment due to its use. No compromise can be made with the protection of the environment.\nI hope that as the whole environment of dowry is friendly to everyone, dowry SEZ will also be environmentally friendly.\nI conclude my words with these words.\nThank you very much all of you.\nDahej is like a mini-India People from all over India are here and are contributing to the nation: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nI have seen the dahj grow strong brick and progress by step: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nDahej-SEZ made its place in the top 50 industrial areas of the world: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nDowry Industrial sector is playing a big role in not only providing employment to millions of youths of the whole country, not just in Gujarat: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nI congratulate the people associated with this for the great success of DAJ-SEZ: PM @narendramodi in Dahej, Gujarat\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nThe government of Gujarat has taken the infrastructure very seriously: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nDue to PCPIR, there has been a very good development of dowry and around Bharuch: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nToday dowry's SEZ, PCPIR and Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation have become very vibrant industrial sites: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nThis is like a child from which I have seen growing up in front of my eyes and therefore I have a lot of emotional attachment here too: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nDaisy SEZ and PCPIR if someone has planted four moons, then OPEL: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nOpel will be a major contributor to big projects like Central Government's Make in India and Smart City: PM @narendramodi\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 7, 2017\nPetrochemical sector is growing rapidly in the country.
