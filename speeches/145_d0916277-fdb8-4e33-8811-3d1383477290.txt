"Share\n\nPM Modi launches #SwachhataHiSeva Movement, gives clarion call for rededicating ourselves towards fulfilling Bapu's dream of a Clean India\nIn the last four years, Swachhata has become a mass movement: PM Modi #SwachhataHiSeva\nNearly 9 crore toilets constructed in the last 4 years, around 4.5 lakh villages, 450 districts and 20 states and union territories had declared ODF: PM #SwachhataHiSeva\nSwachhata must become our Swabhav: PM Modi #SwachhataHiSeva\nYoung people are ambassadors of social change. The way they have furthered the message of cleanliness is commendable: PM Modi #SwachhataHiSeva\nUnclean environment impact poor the most: PM Modi #SwachhataHiSeva\nI welcome and congratulate all the 'Swachagrahis' from the bottom of my heart, who have come from different corners of the country This day, 15th September, is pretty historic in itself. It is historic because it has brought a new determination, enthusiasm and hope. Today you, me and the 125 crore Indians are about to reiterate the resolution of 'Swachhta Hi Seva' or 'Cleanliness is indeed service'. All of us will perform 'shramdaan' and make our contribution with a new zeal and enthusiasm to keep India clean, beginning from today to 2nd October, which is the birth anniversary of Respected Bapuji.\nWe have seen that even though homes are not properly cleaned up on other days. Similarly, we should also try to clean every corner of the country and this behavior should persist for every month and every year.\nThe cleanliness campaign or the movement that started four years ago has now reached a crucial stage. I can proudly say that every section of the nation, every sect, every caste, my friends of different age groups is pushing this great campaign forward. Not a single village, street or city is untouched by this movement\nIndia's coverage of cleanliness in 2014 was just 40%. It has increased to more than 90% Perhaps no one did not think that in just four years; something that could not be done in the last 60-65 years Will anyone have ever thought that nearly 9 crore toilets could be built in the last four years? Had anybody ever imagined that about 4.5 lakh villages will become Defecation Free in the last four years? If someone ever thought that more than 450 districts would be open Defecation Free in the last four years? Had anybody ever thought that 20 states and Union Territories would become Open Defecation Free in the last four years?\nThis is the strength of India and the Indians, the Swachhagrahis. The government alone can not bring about a transformation to such a extent Cleanliness is a critical role in improving the lives of the people in both health and wealth.\nAccording to one of the estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO), cleanliness will play a significant role in saving the lives of 3 lakh people and accordingly to a study, Cleanliness by Diarhhoea by 30%\nHowever, brothers and sisters, just building toilets will not ensure cleanliness of India Providing facilities such as toilets, dustbins and garbage disposal are just a medium. Cleanliness is a habit that needs to be inculcated. This is a Yajna of behavioral change in which every citizen of the country is making his / her positive contribution.\nI am putting efforts to listen to your experiences related to 'Swachh Bharat Mission', learn from you and then all of us together will perform 'shramdaan'. Today we will get the opportunity to visit We will also get the opportunity to know\nOnce again, I want to tell my countrymen that the dedication, contribution, experience and cooperation of Swachhagrahis is commendable! The way the country's noted personalities have participated in this movement, allotted 2 hours of their day for this purpose and shared their experiences, the country where 125 crore Indians have seen this movement all over the world.\nIn the future, whenever the name of this movement, the names of all the Swachhagrihis will be inscribed in Golden letters. I believe that just as the martyrs of the freedom struggle are respected and honored today, your contribution will also be remembered with the same respect and honor; Respected Bapu This is because you have become a warrior of nation building, a savior of the poor and the weak and the credit of establishing the country's pride in the world also goes to you. The strength of the 125 crore Indians is unbridled and limitless. Our enthusiasm is on the rise. Our belief is at its peak Our resolutions are ready for accomplishment and you are ready to perform 'shramdaan' My best wishes to you all I bid my farewell to you as well as 'Shramdaan'\nI once again congratulate you all for your inspiration and hard work. I end my speech by saluting all the great personalities Thanks a lot!\nFrom today to 2nd October, which is Gandhi Jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves towards fulfilling Bapu's dream of a Clean India: PM @narendramodi # SHS18\n- PMO India (@PMOIndia) September 15, 2018\nThe cleanliness movement that started four years ago has now reached a crucial stage.
