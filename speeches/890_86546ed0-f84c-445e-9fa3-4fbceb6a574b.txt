"President of CPAFFC Madame Li Xiaolin\nHon'ble Chief Ministers, Governors and Mayors\nThis is an historical moment in the relationship between India and China.\nToday, we are launching a new vehicle for advancing cooperation between our two countries.\nIn times to come, this will become one of the most important tools\nAs someone who has been Chief Minister for thirteen years and Prime Minister for one, this forum has a special place in my heart.\nBut, it is not just my feelings that lead me to give such importance to this new institution.\nIt comes from a serious conviction, born from my development, that states has a vital role to play in the national development.\nThis is especially true for large and populous countries, with a high degree of geographic, social and economic diversity.\nIt becomes even more relevant, when the constitutional and political systems are federal.\nThese attributes exist in both India and China, the world's two most populous nations\nIn India's Constitution, state governments have the dominant role in economic and social development.\nThe Central Government creates the macro-economic environment It can set the broad social and economic agenda and directions for the nation.\nIt can launch development policies and schemes It can manage resources\nBut, in the end, the state governments have an important role in their implementation.\nBut, as I saw in my own experience, the state government can take the initiative of the development of the states.\nThat is the level of autonomy and responsibility that they enjoy under our Constitution\nIn the same national environment, states are performing at different levels.\nFor business investors, too, whether they are Indian or foreign, their journey may start in Delhi, but their success ends on the state capitals\nMany of the critical requirements for success - infrastructure, land, utilities, skilled human resources and many approvals-overly depend on the state governments\nBut, for me, the involvement of states in our national effort is not just because of their constitutional and legal responsibilities.\nIt is also stems from a basic management theory. The chances of success is higher when we create an understanding of participation for everyone; When we give everyone a stake in success\nThat's why I speak of Team India That is why I believe that the foundation for India's development will not be the single pillar of the Central Government, but 30 pillars including the Central Government and all our States.\nIt follows the simple logic of science It's a very tall structure of development\nThat is why I speak of Cooperative Federalism, when the Center and the States are partners. I also speak of cooperative and competitive federalism, in which states compete with each other to attract investments and jobs.\nWe have moved quickly in the vision.\nWhen we replaced the old Planning Commission with the institution called Niti Ayog, we gave a formal place and role for state government in a nature of this nature for the first time in India.\nWe have been radically increased the resources of the Central Government\nAnd, when we began to raise large revenues from the auction of our coal, it also filled the coffers of the states where the mines are located.\nI am asking my ministries to move out of conferences out of Delhi to state capitals and other cities, so that they do get the benefits that come from hosting such events.\nMore than anything else, we deal with the government\nAnd, in doing so, we do not see the symbol of the political party\nWhich is why, when I invited state governments to participate in this event, I did think the links with their states, but also broader political representation.\nEvery nation needs strong international partnerships for its progress. The linkage has been deepened in an integrated world.\nAs international partnerships in trade, investment, innovation, technology, tourism, education, skills and health grow, state governments have a stake in them and responsibility for their success.\nI have found, both through outbound and inbound state delegations\nA number of decisions\nThese interactions also make the state governments more sensitive and aware of the international dynamics and requirements.\nTherefore, I have great significance to this forum.\nIt is the first that India has any country\nAnd, it is appropriate that it has started with China.\nWe are two of the world's largest economies and among its fastest growing major economies. We have enormous economic synergies.\nWe also face similar challenges We have some similar experiences\nWe have seen differences in the development of different countries.\nOur economic relations are growing rapidly\nDuring President Xi's visit last year, we set up a new level\nWe agreed on China setting up two industrial parks in India - in Maharashtra and Gujarat. We are happy that both Chief Ministers are here. We have agreed on cooperation in the upgrading of India's railway sector.\nI have invited Chinese companies to invest in India's manufacturing sector President Xi spoke about 20 billion dollars of Chinese investments over the next five years. Some of the business agreements will take shape in Shanghai tomorrow.\nI believe it will be much easier to translate our vision in reality, if provincial and state governments come in closer contacts\nIt will also serve our other interests - specially promoting greater people-to-people contacts, which is the heart of all relationships\nBetween India and China, we have already had sister-state relations between Gujarat and Guangdong. We also have a number of sister-city relations\nDuring this visit, we will see the launch of Karnataka Sichuan relations and four sister-city relations.\nIt is also consistent with this spirit that President Xi started his visit to India and I started this visit in Xian.\nThese are welcome developments We are truly taking our relationships outside our national capitals to state capitals and cities\nSo, it is a great pleasure for me to join Premier It will have our full support And, I wish it all success\nThank you."
